### **Practical Implementation Questions:**

21. **How do you create an immutable class with nested objects?**  
    - Discuss deep copying nested mutable objects.

22. **What changes are required to make an existing mutable class immutable?**  
    - Steps to refactor a class for immutability.

23. **Can we create an immutable class with only static methods? Why or why not?**  
    - Explore design choices and use cases.

24. **How can you test if a class is truly immutable?**  
    - Write a test to verify immutability (e.g., by attempting reflection, cloning, etc.).

25. **How does immutability affect garbage collection in Java?**  
    - Explain how fewer object mutations lead to fewer allocations.
