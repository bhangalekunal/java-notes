### **Differences Between Mutable and Immutable Classes**

| **Aspect**                  | **Mutable Classes**                          | **Immutable Classes**                           |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**              | Objects can be modified after creation.     | Objects cannot be modified after creation.     |
| **State**                   | The internal state can change over time.    | The internal state remains constant.           |
| **Thread-Safety**           | Not thread-safe unless explicitly handled.  | Thread-safe due to unchanging state.           |
| **Examples**                | `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `StringBuilder`     | `String`, `Integer`, `BigDecimal`              |
| **Performance**             | Better for frequent modifications.          | Better for situations with constant values.    |
| **Usage**                   | Used where changes to data are required.    | Used where data consistency and safety are important. |
| **Memory Efficiency**       | May reuse memory but risk side effects.     | May create more objects but avoids side effects. |

### **Mutable Class Example: `ArrayList`**

`ArrayList` is a mutable class because you can modify its contents after creation.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class MutableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ArrayList
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");
        
        System.out.println("Original List: " + list);

        // Modify the list
        list.add("Cherry");
        list.remove("Banana");
        
        System.out.println("Modified List: " + list);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Original List: [Apple, Banana]
Modified List: [Apple, Cherry]
```

**Key Points:**
- `list.add()` and `list.remove()` modify the original object.
- The state of the `ArrayList` changes after modifications.

---

### **Immutable Class Example: `String`**

`String` is an immutable class because any modification creates a new object rather than altering the original.

```java
public class ImmutableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a String
        String str = "Hello";
        System.out.println("Original String: " + str);

        // Modify the String
        String newStr = str.concat(" World");
        System.out.println("Modified String: " + newStr);

        // Check if original String changed
        System.out.println("Original String remains: " + str);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Original String: Hello
Modified String: Hello World
Original String remains: Hello
```

**Key Points:**
- The `concat()` method does not modify `str`; instead, it creates a new `String` object.
- The original `str` remains unchanged.

---

### **Why Choose Mutable or Immutable Classes?**

#### **Use Mutable Classes When:**
1. You need to frequently modify the object's state (e.g., `ArrayList` for dynamic collections).
2. Performance matters, and creating new objects is expensive.

#### **Use Immutable Classes When:**
1. You need thread-safe operations without synchronization (e.g., `String` in multi-threaded environments).
2. Data consistency and integrity are critical (e.g., keys in a `HashMap`).

---

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Immutable Objects in Collections:** Immutable objects (e.g., `String`) are safe as keys in collections because their hash code won't change after being added to the collection.
- **Custom Immutable Classes:** You can create your own immutable classes by following the principles [outlined here](#).
