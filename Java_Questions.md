# **Why Java Is Not 100% Object-Oriented?**  

Java is not **100% object-oriented** because it incorporates features that break pure object-oriented principles. These include:  

### **1. Primitive Data Types**  
Java supports **primitive types** (`int`, `char`, `double`, etc.), which are **not objects**. A purely object-oriented language would treat everything as an object.  
Example:  
```java
int number = 10; // Primitive, not an object
Integer numObj = Integer.valueOf(10); // Object
```
Though Java provides wrapper classes (like `Integer`, `Double`), primitives are still widely used.  

---

### **2. Static Methods and Variables**  
Java allows **static methods and variables**, which belong to the class itself rather than an object. This contradicts OOP principles, where methods should be invoked on objects.  
Example:  
```java
class Utility {
    static void printMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Utility.printMessage(); // No object required
    }
}
```
- In pure OOP, you would need to create an object of `Utility` before calling `printMessage()`.  

---

### **3. Functional Programming Features (Java 8+)**  
Java introduced **functional programming concepts**, allowing developers to write code without defining objects explicitly.  

#### **Lambda Expressions**
- Java allows **anonymous functions** (lambda expressions) that are not part of any class instance.  
```java
import java.util.function.Consumer;

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Consumer<String> greet = message -> System.out.println(message);
        greet.accept("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
```
- Here, `greet` is a function that is not tied to an object.  

#### **Streams API and Method References**
- Java allows **stateless functional programming**, bypassing objects entirely.  
```java
import java.util.List;

public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
        names.forEach(System.out::println); // Functional style, no object invocation
    }
}
```

---

### **4. `instanceof` Operator (Breaking Encapsulation)**
- Java allows checking an object’s type using `instanceof`, which breaks encapsulation principles of OOP.  
```java
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        System.out.println(a instanceof Dog); // True
    }
}
```
- Ideally, the type of an object should be hidden from the user, but `instanceof` exposes it.  

---

# **Why Are Pointers Not Allowed in Java?**  

In Java, **pointers are not allowed** mainly due to **security, simplicity, and memory management** reasons. Instead, Java uses **references** to access objects in memory.  

---

### **1. Security and Memory Safety**  
- Pointers allow **direct memory access**, which can lead to **memory corruption, buffer overflow, and unauthorized access**.  
- Java's design focuses on security, and allowing pointers could make programs vulnerable to **hacks and segmentation faults** (like in C/C++).  
- Example in C++ (where memory can be manipulated unsafely):  
  ```cpp
  int *ptr;
  ptr = (int*)0x123456;  // Dangerous: Direct memory access
  *ptr = 100;  // Can cause undefined behavior
  ```
  - In Java, you **cannot** access memory locations directly.

---

### **2. Simplicity and Readability**  
- Pointers make code **complex and error-prone** (e.g., null pointer dereferencing, dangling pointers).  
- Java eliminates the need for manual pointer management, making programs **easier to write, read, and maintain**.  

---

### **3. Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)**  
- Java uses **automatic garbage collection (GC)** to manage memory efficiently.  
- In languages with pointers (like C/C++), developers must manually allocate (`malloc`) and deallocate (`free`) memory, leading to **memory leaks**.  
- Example:  
  ```cpp
  int *ptr = new int(10); // Memory allocated
  delete ptr; // Must be freed manually, or memory leak occurs
  ```
- In Java, memory is managed automatically:  
  ```java
  Integer num = new Integer(10); // No need to delete, GC handles it
  ```

---

### **4. No Dangling or Wild Pointers**  
- In languages with pointers, accessing memory after deallocation leads to **dangling pointers**.  
- Java prevents this by **removing direct memory access** and letting the garbage collector clean up unused objects.  

Example in C++ (dangling pointer):  
```cpp
int *ptr = new int(5);
delete ptr; 
cout << *ptr; // Undefined behavior: Accessing deleted memory
```
Java avoids this by not allowing explicit pointer use.

---

### **5. Prevents Pointer Arithmetic**  
- C/C++ allows pointer arithmetic (`ptr + 1`), which can lead to **segmentation faults** or memory corruption.  
- Java does not allow pointer arithmetic, ensuring **better memory safety**.  

Example in C++ (pointer arithmetic):  
```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *ptr = arr;
ptr++; // Moves to the next memory location
cout << *ptr; // 20
```
- Java avoids this, reducing **accidental memory access violations**.

---

# **What is JIT compiler in java?**
### **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler in Java** 🚀  

The **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler** in Java is a component of the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** that improves the performance of Java applications by **compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime**. This makes Java **faster and more efficient** compared to purely interpreted execution.  

---

## **How Does JIT Work?** 🛠️  
1. **Compilation to Bytecode:**  
   - Java source code (`.java`) is compiled by the **Java Compiler (javac)** into **bytecode** (`.class` file).  
   - Bytecode is **platform-independent** and runs on the **JVM**, not directly on the CPU.  
     
2. **Interpretation vs. Compilation:**  
   - JVM **interprets** the bytecode line by line, which is **slower**.  
   - To optimize performance, JIT compiles frequently used bytecode **into native machine code** for faster execution.  
     
3. **JIT Compilation Process:**  
   - The **JVM monitors methods that are executed frequently** (hot methods).  
   - When a method is used **multiple times**, the JIT compiler **compiles it into machine code**.  
   - The next time the method runs, the JVM **executes the compiled native code directly**, improving performance.  

---

## **Types of JIT Compilation Modes**  
Java JIT operates in different modes for performance optimization:  

1. **Client (C1) Compiler (Tier 1) 📌**  
   - Used for **quick startup and lightweight performance improvements**.  
   - Ideal for **GUI applications or small programs**.  

2. **Server (C2) Compiler (Tier 4) 🔥**  
   - Focuses on **advanced optimizations** like **inlining, loop unrolling, and dead code elimination**.  
   - Used for **long-running applications** (e.g., enterprise applications, servers).  

3. **Tiered Compilation ⚙️**  
   - Combines **Client (C1) and Server (C2)** modes to balance **fast startup and high performance**.  
   - JVM first compiles methods using **C1 (faster, less optimized)**, then upgrades them using **C2 (slower, highly optimized)**.  

---

## **JIT Optimization Techniques** 🚀  
JIT applies various optimizations to speed up execution:  

✅ **Method Inlining:** Replaces a method call with its actual code to reduce function call overhead.  
✅ **Loop Unrolling:** Expands loops to decrease iteration overhead.  
✅ **Dead Code Elimination:** Removes unused or unnecessary code.  
✅ **Constant Folding:** Replaces expressions with their precomputed constant values.  

---

## **JIT vs. AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compilation**  
| Feature | JIT (Just-In-Time) | AOT (Ahead-of-Time) |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Compilation Time | At runtime | Before execution |
| Performance | Improves over time | Fast from the start |
| Optimization | Dynamic, based on execution patterns | Static, fixed at compile-time |
| Use Cases | Java, JVM-based languages | Native executables (GraalVM, Android ART) |

# **Why is String Immutable in Java?** 🛠️🔒  

In Java, the **`String` class is immutable**, meaning once a `String` object is created, its value **cannot be changed**. Instead, any modification results in the creation of a **new `String` object**.  

This immutability is by **design** and has several important benefits. Let's explore the **reasons** behind making `String` immutable in Java.  

---

## **1️⃣ Security Reasons 🔐**  
- `String` is widely used for storing **sensitive data** such as **passwords, usernames, database connection URLs, and file paths**.  
- If `String` were mutable, hackers could modify its contents, leading to **security vulnerabilities** in authentication and file handling.  

**Example:**  
```java
String dbUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb";
dbUrl.replace("localhost", "malicious_host"); // If mutable, this would be a security risk!
```
➡ **Since `String` is immutable, such modifications create a new object instead of altering the original one.**  

---

## **2️⃣ Performance Optimization (String Pool) ⚡**  
- Java maintains a special **"String Pool" (String Constant Pool)** in memory to optimize storage and performance.  
- When a `String` is created using **string literals**, it is stored in the pool and reused if another identical `String` is created.  

**Example:**  
```java
String s1 = "Java";
String s2 = "Java"; // Reuses the same object from the String Pool
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true (same reference)
```
➡ **If `String` were mutable, changes to one reference would affect all references, breaking this optimization.**  

---

## **3️⃣ Thread Safety 🧵**  
- Since `String` is immutable, it is **automatically thread-safe**.  
- Multiple threads can share the same `String` instance **without synchronization issues**.  

**Example (Multi-threading scenario):**  
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    String message = "Hello";
    
    public void run() {
        message.concat(" World"); // Creates a new String but doesn't modify the original
    }
}
```
➡ **If `String` were mutable, multiple threads modifying the same `String` instance could cause inconsistent behavior.**  

---

## **4️⃣ Hashcode Caching (Used in HashMap & HashSet) 🗂️**  
- `String`'s `hashCode()` is frequently used in **HashMap, HashSet, and HashTable** for **fast retrieval**.  
- Since `String` is immutable, the hashcode is **calculated only once and stored**.  

**Example:**  
```java
String key = "username";
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(key, 123);

// Hashcode remains the same even if the original reference is reassigned
key = "password"; // Doesn't affect map.get("username")
```
➡ **If `String` were mutable, changing its value would alter its `hashCode()`, breaking HashMap integrity.**  

---

## **5️⃣ Class Loading Mechanism 📂**  
- `String` is heavily used in **class loading** (e.g., `Class.forName("com.mysql.Driver")`).  
- If `String` were mutable, malicious code could **modify the class name dynamically** and load an unintended class, causing security breaches.  

---

## **🔹 Conclusion: Why String is Immutable?**  
| **Reason** | **Benefit** |
|------------|------------|
| **Security** | Prevents unauthorized modifications to sensitive data |
| **Performance Optimization** | Enables String Pooling for memory efficiency |
| **Thread Safety** | No synchronization required, avoids race conditions |
| **Hashcode Caching** | Ensures stable keys in HashMap & HashSet |
| **Class Loading Safety** | Prevents runtime security vulnerabilities |

✅ **Java designers made `String` immutable to improve security, performance, and reliability in multi-threaded environments.** 🚀

# **What is a Marker Interface in Java?** 🏷️  

A **Marker Interface** in Java is an **interface with no methods or fields**. It is used to **mark** a class so that the Java runtime or framework can identify and apply specific behavior to objects of that class.  

---

## **🔹 Key Features of Marker Interface**  
1. **No Methods or Fields** – It is an **empty interface** (also called a "tagging interface").  
2. **Used for Type Identification** – Helps Java runtime or frameworks recognize classes that implement it.  
3. **Used for Special Behaviors** – Classes implementing marker interfaces are treated differently by JVM or libraries.  

---

## **🔹 Examples of Built-in Marker Interfaces in Java**  

### **1️⃣ `Serializable` (java.io.Serializable) – Enables Object Serialization**  
- A class implementing `Serializable` **can be converted into a byte stream** and saved to a file or sent over a network.  

**Example:**  
```java
import java.io.*;

class Employee implements Serializable {  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    Employee(int id, String name) {  
        this.id = id;  
        this.name = name;  
    }  
}  
```
➡ **Since `Serializable` has no methods, the JVM simply checks if a class implements it before serialization.**  

---

### **2️⃣ `Cloneable` (java.lang.Cloneable) – Enables Cloning of Objects**  
- If a class implements `Cloneable`, its objects can be **cloned** using the `clone()` method.  
- Without `Cloneable`, calling `clone()` on an object **throws `CloneNotSupportedException`**.  

**Example:**  
```java
class Person implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    
    Person(String name) { this.name = name; }

    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone(); // Allowed because of Cloneable
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Person p1 = new Person("John");
        Person p2 = (Person) p1.clone();
        System.out.println(p2.name); // Output: John
    }
}
```
➡ **JVM allows cloning only if the class implements `Cloneable`.**  

---

### **3️⃣ `Remote` (java.rmi.Remote) – Enables Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**  
- Used in **distributed computing** where an object can be accessed remotely.  
- A class implementing `Remote` can expose methods that can be **invoked from another JVM over the network**.  

---

## **🔹 Can We Create Custom Marker Interfaces?**  
Yes! You can create your **own marker interface** for custom behavior.  

**Example:**  
```java
interface VIP {}  // Custom marker interface

class Customer implements VIP { 
    String name;
    Customer(String name) { this.name = name; }
}

// Method to check if a customer is VIP
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Customer c = new Customer("Alice");
        
        if (c instanceof VIP) {  // Checking marker interface
            System.out.println(c.name + " is a VIP Customer!");
        } else {
            System.out.println(c.name + " is a Regular Customer.");
        }
    }
}
```
✅ **Output:**  
```
Alice is a VIP Customer!
```
➡ **Even without methods, the marker interface helps identify special classes.**  

---

## **🔹 Alternative to Marker Interfaces: Annotations 📌**  
Since Java 5, **Annotations** (e.g., `@Override`, `@Deprecated`) have replaced many marker interfaces.  
🔹 Instead of:  
```java
interface Auditable {}  
class User implements Auditable {}  
```
🔹 We can use an annotation:  
```java
@interface Auditable {}  
@Auditable  
class User {}  
```
✅ **Annotations provide more flexibility and metadata compared to marker interfaces.**  

---

## **🔹 Conclusion: Why Use Marker Interfaces?**  

| **Feature** | **Marker Interface** | **Annotations** |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Type identification | Additional metadata |
| **Methods?** | No | Can have attributes |
| **JVM Processing** | Checked at runtime | Processed at compile/runtime |
| **Example** | `Serializable`, `Cloneable` | `@Override`, `@Deprecated` |

📌 **Today, marker interfaces are mostly replaced by annotations, but they are still useful in legacy systems and for JVM-based checks like serialization and cloning.** 🚀

# **Can You Override `private` or `static` Methods in Java?**  

#### **1️⃣ Can You Override a `private` Method?** 🚫  
**No**, **private methods cannot be overridden** because they are **not inherited** by subclasses.  

**Example:**  
```java
class Parent {
    private void show() {  // Private method
        System.out.println("Parent's show() method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    private void show() {  // This is NOT overriding, it's a separate method
        System.out.println("Child's show() method");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        // p.show();  // ❌ Compilation error: show() is private in Parent
    }
}
```
🔹 **Explanation:**  
- `private` methods **belong only to the class** in which they are defined.  
- The `Child` class defines a new `show()` method, but it does not override the one in `Parent`.  
- **Solution:** If you want to override, you should use `protected` or `public` instead of `private`.

---

#### **2️⃣ Can You Override a `static` Method?** 🚫  
**No**, **static methods cannot be overridden** because they are **associated with the class, not instances**. However, they **can be hidden** by defining a method with the same signature in the subclass.  

**Example:**  
```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {  // Static method
        System.out.println("Parent's static show()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() {  // This is method hiding, NOT overriding
        System.out.println("Child's static show()");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        p.show();  // Output: Parent's static show()
    }
}
```
🔹 **Explanation:**  
- Since `show()` is static, **method hiding occurs instead of overriding**.  
- **Method is called based on the reference type (`Parent`), not the object (`Child`).**  
- If it were a normal (non-static) method, dynamic method dispatch (runtime polymorphism) would happen, and the `Child` method would be called.

---

### **🔹 Summary**
| **Method Type** | **Can Be Overridden?** | **Reason** |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `private` | ❌ No | Not inherited by subclasses |
| `static` | ❌ No (but can be hidden) | Belongs to the class, not instances |

🚀 **If you want method overriding, use `protected` or `public` methods instead!**

# **Does `finally` Always Execute in Java?**  

In Java, the `finally` block is **guaranteed to execute** **except in a few special cases**. Let's explore when it executes and when it might not.

---

### ✅ **`finally` Executes in Most Cases**
The `finally` block **always executes** after the `try` block, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

**Example 1: `finally` executes after `try` block (No Exception)**
```java
public class FinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Inside catch block");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Inside try block
Inside finally block
```

---

**Example 2: `finally` executes even if an exception occurs**
```java
public class FinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            int a = 5 / 0;  // This causes ArithmeticException
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Inside catch block");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Inside try block
Inside catch block
Inside finally block
```

---

### ❌ **When `finally` Does NOT Execute**
Although `finally` **almost always executes**, there are a few special cases where it does **not**:

1. **System.exit() is called inside `try` or `catch`**
   ```java
   public class FinallyNotExecuted {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try {
               System.out.println("Inside try block");
               System.exit(0);  // Terminates JVM
           } finally {
               System.out.println("Inside finally block");
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   Inside try block
   ```
   🚨 **Explanation:** Since `System.exit(0)` **immediately stops the JVM**, the `finally` block **will not execute**.

---

2. **The JVM crashes due to an error (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`)**
   ```java
   public class FinallyNotExecuted {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try {
               int[] arr = new int[Integer.MAX_VALUE];  // Causes OutOfMemoryError
           } finally {
               System.out.println("Inside finally block");
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   (Program crashes with OutOfMemoryError, finally may not execute)
   ```

---

3. **Infinite loop or program termination in `try` or `catch`**
   ```java
   public class FinallyNotExecuted {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try {
               while (true) {}  // Infinite loop
           } finally {
               System.out.println("Inside finally block");
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   (Program runs forever, finally never executes)
   ```

---

### **🔹 Summary Table**
| Case | Does `finally` Execute? | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Normal execution | ✅ Yes | Always executes |
| Exception occurs | ✅ Yes | Executes after `catch` block |
| `return` inside `try/catch` | ✅ Yes | Executes before returning |
| `System.exit(0)` inside `try/catch` | ❌ No | JVM shuts down |
| JVM crashes (OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError) | ❌ No | Uncontrolled crash |
| Infinite loop in `try` or `catch` | ❌ No | Execution never reaches `finally` |

### **🔹 Conclusion**
🚀 **In 99% of cases, `finally` executes!** However, if the JVM shuts down (`System.exit(0)`) or crashes, `finally` **might not** run.

Would you like an example where `finally` executes even when a `return` statement is used? 😊

# **What Methods Does the Object Class Have?**
The `Object` class in Java is the root class of the Java class hierarchy. Every class in Java implicitly inherits from `Object`. It provides several important methods that are available to all Java objects. Here are the key methods of the `Object` class:

1. **`clone()`**  
   - **Description:** Creates and returns a copy of the object. The object must implement the `Cloneable` interface to allow cloning.  
   - **Signature:** `protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException`

2. **`equals(Object obj)`**  
   - **Description:** Compares this object to the specified object for equality. The default implementation compares memory addresses, but it can be overridden for meaningful comparison.  
   - **Signature:** `public boolean equals(Object obj)`

3. **`finalize()`**  
   - **Description:** Called by the garbage collector when there are no more references to the object. It is used to perform cleanup before an object is destroyed.  
   - **Signature:** `protected void finalize() throws Throwable`

4. **`getClass()`**  
   - **Description:** Returns the runtime class of the object. This can be useful to obtain the class type of an object.  
   - **Signature:** `public final Class<?> getClass()`

5. **`hashCode()`**  
   - **Description:** Returns a hash code for the object. This method is used in hashing-based collections like `HashMap` or `HashSet`. The default implementation returns a unique integer for the object, but it is often overridden.  
   - **Signature:** `public int hashCode()`

6. **`notify()`**  
   - **Description:** Wakes up one thread that is waiting on the object’s monitor. This method is used in synchronized blocks for inter-thread communication.  
   - **Signature:** `public final void notify()`

7. **`notifyAll()`**  
   - **Description:** Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object’s monitor. Like `notify()`, it is used for inter-thread communication.  
   - **Signature:** `public final void notifyAll()`

8. **`toString()`**  
   - **Description:** Returns a string representation of the object. By default, it returns a string containing the class name and the object’s hash code, but this method can be overridden to provide a more meaningful representation.  
   - **Signature:** `public String toString()`

9. **`wait()`**  
   - **Description:** Causes the current thread to wait until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object. It can also be used with a timeout.  
   - **Signature:**  
     - `public final void wait() throws InterruptedException`
     - `public final void wait(long timeout) throws InterruptedException`
     - `public final void wait(long timeout, int nanos) throws InterruptedException`

These methods are inherited by all classes in Java, and many of them can be overridden for specific behavior in user-defined classes.

# **How Can You Make a Class Immutable?**
To make a class **immutable** in Java, you need to follow a set of design principles that ensure that once an object is created, its state cannot be changed. Here are the steps to create an immutable class:

### 1. **Make the Class `final`**
   - Declare the class as `final` so that it cannot be subclassed. This prevents subclasses from altering its immutable behavior.
   ```java
   public final class MyClass {
       // Class implementation
   }
   ```

### 2. **Make All Fields `final` and `private`**
   - Declare all fields of the class as `final` so that they cannot be reassigned after the object is constructed.
   - Declare all fields as `private` so they are not directly accessible outside the class.
   ```java
   private final String name;
   private final int age;
   ```

### 3. **Do Not Provide "Setter" Methods**
   - Avoid providing setter methods for modifying the fields after the object is created. This ensures that the object's state remains unchanged.
   ```java
   // No setter methods
   ```

### 4. **Initialize Fields Only in the Constructor**
   - Set the values of fields only in the constructor and make sure the constructor initializes every field.
   - If the class has mutable objects as fields (e.g., arrays, lists), make sure to clone them before storing them. This prevents external modification of mutable objects.
   ```java
   public MyClass(String name, int age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
   }
   ```

### 5. **Ensure Deep Copies for Mutable Fields**
   - If the class contains fields that are references to mutable objects (like arrays, collections, or custom objects), make sure to create a **deep copy** of the objects in the constructor and return a deep copy when accessing them via getters. This ensures that the caller cannot modify the internal state of the immutable class.

   For example, if your class has an array:
   ```java
   private final int[] scores;

   public MyClass(int[] scores) {
       this.scores = scores.clone();  // Create a deep copy
   }

   public int[] getScores() {
       return scores.clone();  // Return a copy of the array
   }
   ```

### 6. **Override the `toString()`, `hashCode()`, and `equals()` Methods (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Override `toString()`, `hashCode()`, and `equals()` methods to ensure that the object behaves correctly when used in collections or printed.

### Example of an Immutable Class:

```java
public final class Person {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;
    private final int[] scores;

    // Constructor
    public Person(String name, int age, int[] scores) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.scores = scores.clone(); // Ensuring deep copy for mutable object
    }

    // Getter methods (no setters)
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public int[] getScores() {
        return scores.clone();  // Returning a copy of the array
    }

    // Optional: Override equals, hashCode, and toString
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + "}";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Person person = (Person) o;
        return age == person.age && name.equals(person.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Final class:** Prevents subclassing, which could otherwise alter the immutable behavior.
- **Final fields:** Ensures the fields cannot be reassigned after initialization.
- **Private fields:** Protects fields from direct modification.
- **No setters:** Ensures the object cannot be modified externally after creation.
- **Deep copying:** Protects the object from changes to mutable fields.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your class remains immutable, providing a robust and thread-safe design.

# **What is singleton class in Java and how can we make a class singleton?**
### **What is a Singleton Class in Java?**

A **Singleton class** in Java is a class that allows only **one instance** of itself to be created and provides a global point of access to that instance. This ensures that there is a single, shared instance of the class, which is often useful for managing resources like database connections, configuration settings, or thread pools.

### **How to Make a Class Singleton in Java?**

To make a class **Singleton** in Java, we must ensure the following characteristics:

1. **Private Constructor**: The constructor of the class should be private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
2. **Static Instance**: A static instance of the class should be created, which will be the only instance available.
3. **Global Access Method**: A public method (usually named `getInstance()`) should be provided to give access to the single instance.
4. **Thread Safety**: If the class is used in a multithreaded environment, proper synchronization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure thread safety.
5. **Reflection Safety**: Prevent the instance from being created via reflection (which could bypass the private constructor).
6. **Serialization Safety**: Ensure that the Singleton class does not break during serialization/deserialization (this is done using the `readResolve()` method).
7. **Clone Safety**: Prevent the Singleton class from being cloned, which could create another instance of the class.

### **Singleton Class Example with All Safety Guards:**

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Singleton implements Serializable, Cloneable {
    // volatile ensures that multiple threads handle the instance variable correctly
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {
        // Prevent reflection from creating a new instance
        if (instance != null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Instance already created!");
        }
    }

    // Public method to get the instance, uses double-checked locking for thread safety
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton(); // Lazy initialization
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // This method ensures that when the object is deserialized, the same instance is returned
    protected Object readResolve() {
        return getInstance();
    }

    // Override clone method to prevent cloning
    @Override
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        throw new CloneNotSupportedException("Cloning not allowed for Singleton class!");
    }
    
    // Example method for Singleton class
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something with the Singleton instance!");
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of Key Elements:**

1. **Private Constructor**:
   - The constructor is private to prevent any external instantiation.

2. **Static `getInstance()` Method**:
   - The static method `getInstance()` is used to provide access to the Singleton instance.
   - **Double-Checked Locking**: This ensures lazy initialization and minimizes the synchronization overhead.
   - The `volatile` keyword is used to ensure that multiple threads handle the instance correctly.

3. **Reflection Safety**:
   - In the constructor, we check if the instance is already created and throw an `IllegalStateException` if any attempt is made to create a new instance through reflection.

4. **Serialization Safety**:
   - The `readResolve()` method ensures that when the object is deserialized, it returns the existing instance instead of creating a new one.

5. **Clone Safety**:
   - The `clone()` method is overridden to throw a `CloneNotSupportedException` to prevent cloning of the Singleton class.

### **Usage Example:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton singleton1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton singleton2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        // Verifying that both references point to the same instance
        System.out.println(singleton1 == singleton2); // Should print true

        // Using the Singleton instance
        singleton1.doSomething();
        
        // Try to clone (will throw CloneNotSupportedException)
        try {
            Singleton singletonClone = (Singleton) singleton1.clone();
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // Should print: "Cloning not allowed for Singleton class!"
        }
    }
}
```

### **Summary:**
To make a class a Singleton in Java, follow these steps:
1. Make the constructor private.
2. Provide a public static method (`getInstance()`) to access the Singleton instance.
3. Implement thread safety (using `synchronized` or `volatile` for lazy initialization).
4. Add **reflection**, **serialization**, and **clone safety** to ensure the integrity of the Singleton pattern.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the class is a properly implemented Singleton in Java.


# **Explain collection Hierarchy.**
### **Collection Hierarchy in Java**  

In Java, the **Collection Framework** provides a well-defined hierarchy of interfaces and classes for managing a group of objects. This hierarchy is divided into three main parts:  
- **Collection Interface (for storing individual objects)**
- **Map Interface (for key-value pairs)**
- **Utility classes (like Arrays, Collections, etc.)**

---

### **1️⃣ Collection Interface Hierarchy**  

#### **`java.util.Collection` (Root Interface)**
- **Superinterface of all collection classes.**
- Defines basic operations like `add()`, `remove()`, `size()`, etc.

#### **↳ List Interface (Ordered, Allows Duplicates)**
- **Preserves insertion order.**
- **Allows duplicate elements.**
- Indexed-based access (`get(index)`).

##### **Implementations of List:**
1. **ArrayList** (Fast, dynamic array)
   - Uses a dynamic array internally.
   - Fast read (`O(1)`) but slow insertion/deletion (`O(n)`).
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
     list.add("A");
     list.add("B");
     ```

2. **LinkedList** (Doubly Linked List)
   - Uses a **doubly linked list** internally.
   - **Fast insertion/deletion (`O(1)`) but slower access (`O(n)`).**
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     List<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
     list.add("A");
     list.add("B");
     ```

3. **Vector** (Synchronized version of ArrayList)
   - **Thread-safe** (but slower due to synchronization).
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     List<String> vector = new Vector<>();
     vector.add("A");
     ```

4. **Stack** (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
   - Subclass of `Vector`.
   - Provides `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
     stack.push(10);
     stack.pop();
     ```

---

#### **↳ Set Interface (Unique Elements, Unordered)**
- **Does not allow duplicates.**
- No index-based access.

##### **Implementations of Set:**
1. **HashSet** (Unordered, Uses HashTable)
   - **Does not maintain insertion order.**
   - Fast operations (`O(1)`) but **random order**.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
     set.add("A");
     set.add("B");
     ```

2. **LinkedHashSet** (Maintains Insertion Order)
   - **Preserves insertion order.**
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Set<String> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();
     set.add("A");
     set.add("B");
     ```

3. **TreeSet** (Sorted Set, Uses Red-Black Tree)
   - **Stores elements in sorted order (natural/comparator).**
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
     set.add(5);
     set.add(1);
     ```

---

#### **↳ Queue Interface (FIFO - First In, First Out)**
- **Elements processed in order of insertion.**
- Used in **task scheduling, buffering, etc.**

##### **Implementations of Queue:**
1. **PriorityQueue** (Sorted Queue)
   - Orders elements based on priority (natural or comparator).
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Queue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>();
     queue.add(10);
     queue.add(5);
     queue.add(15);
     ```

2. **ArrayDeque** (Efficient Double-Ended Queue)
   - **Faster than `Stack` and `LinkedList`** for stack/queue operations.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
     deque.addFirst(1);
     deque.addLast(2);
     ```

---

### **2️⃣ Map Interface Hierarchy (Key-Value Pairs)**  

#### **↳ Map Interface**
- Stores **(key, value) pairs**.
- **Keys must be unique**, but values can be duplicate.

##### **Implementations of Map:**
1. **HashMap** (Unordered, Fast)
   - Stores key-value pairs in a **hash table**.
   - **Does not maintain insertion order.**
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
     map.put(1, "A");
     map.put(2, "B");
     ```

2. **LinkedHashMap** (Ordered HashMap)
   - **Maintains insertion order.**
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Map<Integer, String> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();
     map.put(1, "A");
     map.put(2, "B");
     ```

3. **TreeMap** (Sorted Map, Red-Black Tree)
   - Stores keys in **sorted order (natural/comparator).**
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Map<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
     map.put(2, "B");
     map.put(1, "A");
     ```

4. **Hashtable** (Thread-safe, Synchronized)
   - Similar to `HashMap`, but **synchronized**.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Map<Integer, String> table = new Hashtable<>();
     table.put(1, "A");
     ```

### **🔹 Conclusion**
- **Lists** allow duplicates and maintain order.
- **Sets** ensure uniqueness.
- **Queues** work in FIFO order.
- **Maps** store key-value pairs.

# **Why Doesn't `Map` Extend the `Collection` Interface in Java?**  

In Java, the **`Map` interface** does **not** extend the **`Collection` interface**, and this is by design. The main reasons are:

---

### **1️⃣ Conceptual Difference**
- **`Collection<E>`** is designed for storing a **group of individual elements**.
- **`Map<K, V>`** is designed for storing **key-value pairs**, where each key is unique.

Extending `Collection` would force `Map` to follow rules that don’t fit its structure, such as:
- **Allowing duplicate elements** (but `Map` requires unique keys).
- **Providing iterator-based access** (but `Map` is accessed by keys, not iteration).

---

### **2️⃣ Different Data Structures**
A `Collection` is typically a **list**, **set**, or **queue**, which holds individual elements in some order. However, a `Map` uses **key-value pairs**, making it more like a dictionary or a lookup table.  

For example:  
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Apple"); // Single elements stored

Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(1, "Apple"); // Key-Value pairs stored
```

---

### **3️⃣ Incompatibility with `Collection` Methods**
If `Map` extended `Collection`, it would be forced to implement methods that don't make sense, such as:
- **`add(E e)`** → `Map` requires key-value pairs (`put(K, V)`) instead.
- **`iterator()`** → `Map` doesn't store elements linearly.

Since `Map` has a completely different structure, its access patterns and operations **don't align with `Collection`'s contract**.

---

### **4️⃣ Alternative Design Choice: `Map` Provides Collection Views**
Instead of extending `Collection`, the `Map` interface provides **views** that follow the `Collection` interface:
- **`map.keySet()`** → Returns a `Set<K>` of keys.
- **`map.values()`** → Returns a `Collection<V>` of values.
- **`map.entrySet()`** → Returns a `Set<Map.Entry<K, V>>` of key-value pairs.

This approach allows `Map` to **interact with the Collection framework while keeping its unique structure**.

Example:
```java
Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(1, "Apple");
map.put(2, "Banana");

// Get key set (as a Collection)
Set<Integer> keys = map.keySet();

// Get values (as a Collection)
Collection<String> values = map.values();
```

---

### **🔹 Conclusion**
- `Map` is **not a true "collection"** of elements but rather a **mapping of keys to values**.
- If `Map` extended `Collection`, it would **inherit methods that don’t logically apply** to key-value structures.
- Instead, Java provides **`keySet()`, `values()`, and `entrySet()`** for Collection-like behavior.


# **What are the difference between Fail-Fast and Fail-Safe Iterator in Java**

Iterators in Java can be categorized as **Fail-Fast** and **Fail-Safe** based on how they handle concurrent modifications of a collection.

---

### **1️⃣ Fail-Fast Iterator**
**🔹 Definition:**  
A **Fail-Fast Iterator** throws a **`ConcurrentModificationException`** if the collection is modified while iterating, except via the iterator’s own `remove()` method.

**🔹 Key Characteristics:**
- Directly accesses the collection’s structure.
- Fails immediately if the collection is modified **during iteration**.
- Uses **modCount** (modification count) to detect concurrent modification.

**🔹 Examples of Fail-Fast Iterators:**
- `ArrayList`
- `HashSet`
- `HashMap` (for `keySet()`, `values()`, and `entrySet()` iterators)

**🔹 Code Example (Fail-Fast)**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class FailFastExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("A");
        list.add("B");
        list.add("C");

        Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
            list.add("D");  // Modifying collection while iterating
        }
    }
}
```
**🔸 Output:**  
```
A
Exception in thread "main" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
```
---

### **2️⃣ Fail-Safe Iterator**
**🔹 Definition:**  
A **Fail-Safe Iterator** does **not throw `ConcurrentModificationException`** because it iterates over a **clone** of the collection instead of the original one.

**🔹 Key Characteristics:**
- Works on a **copy** of the collection, so modifications don’t affect iteration.
- Doesn’t reflect changes made during iteration.
- Uses **Copy-on-Write** or **snapshot mechanism**.

**🔹 Examples of Fail-Safe Iterators:**
- `CopyOnWriteArrayList`
- `CopyOnWriteArraySet`
- `ConcurrentHashMap`

**🔹 Code Example (Fail-Safe)**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FailSafeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
        list.add("A");
        list.add("B");
        list.add("C");

        Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
            list.add("D"); // Modifying collection while iterating (No Exception)
        }
    }
}
```
**🔸 Output:**  
```
A
B
C
```
(No exception occurs, but `"D"` won’t be reflected in this iteration)

---

### **3️⃣ Key Differences:**
| Feature         | **Fail-Fast Iterator** | **Fail-Safe Iterator** |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Exception Handling** | Throws `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified | No exception, operates on a copy |
| **Modification** | Detects modification via `modCount` | Uses a cloned copy (snapshot) |
| **Thread-Safety** | Not thread-safe | Thread-safe |
| **Performance** | Faster but not safe for concurrent modification | Slower due to extra memory overhead |
| **Example Collections** | `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap` | `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `ConcurrentHashMap` |

---

### **4️⃣ When to Use Which?**
- **Use Fail-Fast iterators** when working with **single-threaded** applications where **modifications should not happen during iteration**.
- **Use Fail-Safe iterators** in **multi-threaded environments** where concurrent modification is expected.

---

### **🔹 Conclusion**
- **Fail-Fast iterators** are faster but throw an exception if the collection is modified.
- **Fail-Safe iterators** allow modifications but operate on a cloned copy, making them **safe but less efficient**.

# **What do you understand by BlockingQueue in Java?**
### **🔹 Definition**
A `BlockingQueue` is a type of queue in Java that **supports operations that wait** for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving elements and wait for space to become available when storing elements.

It is particularly useful in **multi-threaded environments** where **one thread** is **producing** items and **another thread** is **consuming** them.

---

### **🔹 Key Features**
1. **Thread-safe** – Designed for concurrent access without explicit synchronization.
2. **Blocking Operations** – 
   - `take()`: Waits if the queue is **empty** until an element becomes available.
   - `put()`: Waits if the queue is **full** until space is available.
3. **No `null` Values** – Unlike normal queues, `BlockingQueue` **does not allow null values**.
4. **Can Have Capacity Limits** – Some implementations have a **fixed size**, while others can be **unbounded**.
5. **Does Not Support Iterators** – Unlike normal queues, its iterators do not necessarily reflect the latest elements.

---

### **🔹 BlockingQueue Implementations in Java**
The `BlockingQueue` interface is part of **`java.util.concurrent`** package and has different implementations:

| **BlockingQueue Type** | **Description** |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ArrayBlockingQueue` | Fixed-size, **bounded** blocking queue (uses an array internally). |
| `LinkedBlockingQueue` | Optionally **bounded**, uses a linked list internally. |
| `PriorityBlockingQueue` | **Unbounded**, sorts elements based on their priority. |
| `DelayQueue` | Stores elements with an associated **delay time**, elements become available only after the delay expires. |
| `SynchronousQueue` | No storage; **each insert must wait for a remove**, useful for handoff scenarios. |
| `LinkedTransferQueue` | Optimized for producer-consumer patterns, more advanced than `LinkedBlockingQueue`. |

---

### **🔹 Example: Producer-Consumer Using `BlockingQueue`**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class BlockingQueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);

        // Producer thread
        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                    queue.put(i);  // Puts element into queue (waits if full)
                    System.out.println("Produced: " + i);
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        // Consumer thread
        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                while (true) {
                    int item = queue.take();  // Takes element from queue (waits if empty)
                    System.out.println("Consumed: " + item);
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

### **🔹 Output**
```
Produced: 1
Consumed: 1
Produced: 2
Produced: 3
Consumed: 2
Produced: 4
Produced: 5
Consumed: 3
Produced: 6
...
```
🔹 The **producer waits** if the queue is full, and the **consumer waits** if the queue is empty.

### **🔹 When to Use `BlockingQueue`?**
✅ When implementing **Producer-Consumer** pattern.  
✅ When handling **multi-threaded** communication.  
✅ When you need to **limit memory usage** (bounded queue).  
✅ When you need **safe, thread-controlled access** to shared resources.

---

### **🔹 Key Differences Between `Queue` and `BlockingQueue`**
| Feature           | `Queue` (e.g., `LinkedList`) | `BlockingQueue` (e.g., `ArrayBlockingQueue`) |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Thread Safety** | **Not thread-safe** | **Thread-safe** |
| **Blocking Methods** | **No blocking** | **Blocks on full/empty** |
| **Capacity** | **Unbounded** | **Can be bounded or unbounded** |
| **Operations on Full Queue** | Throws exception | Waits (`put()` method) |
| **Operations on Empty Queue** | Returns `null` | Waits (`take()` method) |

---

### **🔹 Conclusion**
- `BlockingQueue` is a **thread-safe queue** that supports **blocking operations**.
- It **prevents concurrency issues** by handling synchronization internally.
- Ideal for **producer-consumer** and **multi-threading** scenarios.

Would you like an example with a **different implementation** like `SynchronousQueue` or `PriorityBlockingQueue`? 🚀

# **Explain Internal Working of `HashMap` in Java**
The `HashMap` in Java is part of the `java.util` package and is widely used for key-value storage. It is based on **hashing** and provides **O(1) average time complexity** for operations like **get()** and **put()**.

---

### **🔹 Data Structure Used**
Internally, `HashMap` uses an **array of buckets (Node<K, V>[])** where each bucket is a **linked list** (or a balanced tree in some cases). Each key-value pair is stored as an **entry** inside these buckets.

From Java **8 onwards**, if the number of entries in a bucket exceeds **8**, the linked list is converted into a **Red-Black Tree** to optimize search performance.

---

### **🔹 Internal Structure of `HashMap`**
Each entry in `HashMap` is represented as a **Node<K, V>** (previously `Entry<K, V>` in Java 7):

```java
static class Node<K, V> {
    final int hash;   // Hashcode of key
    final K key;      // Key
    V value;          // Value
    Node<K, V> next;  // Pointer to next node in the bucket

    Node(int hash, K key, V value, Node<K, V> next) {
        this.hash = hash;
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
        this.next = next;
    }
}
```

---

## **🔹 How `put(K key, V value)` Works?**
1. **Compute Hash** – The key’s `hashCode()` is computed and transformed into an **index** using `indexFor(hash, capacity)`.
2. **Find Bucket** – The calculated index determines which bucket (array index) will store the entry.
3. **Check for Collision**:
   - If **no collision** (i.e., the bucket is empty), insert the new node.
   - If **collision** occurs (another entry exists at the same index), it checks using `.equals()`:
     - If **keys are the same**, **update** the value.
     - If **different keys**, add the new entry at the end of the linked list.
4. **Convert to Red-Black Tree** – If the bucket size exceeds 8, it converts to a **tree** for faster lookup.

### **🔹 Example**
```java
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("Apple", 100);
map.put("Orange", 200);
map.put("Banana", 300);
```

### **🔹 Bucket Index Calculation**
1. `hash("Apple")` → **hash value** (e.g., `12345678`).
2. `index = hash & (n-1)` where `n` is the capacity (default `16`).
3. Value is stored at the computed index.

---

## **🔹 How `get(K key)` Works?**
1. **Compute Hash** – The hash of the key is computed.
2. **Find Bucket** – The index is determined using `indexFor(hash, capacity)`.
3. **Search in the Bucket**:
   - If a single entry exists, return its value.
   - If multiple entries exist (collision), iterate using `.equals()` to find the matching key.
4. **Return the Value**.

---

## **🔹 Handling Collisions**
Since multiple keys can map to the **same bucket index**, Java uses:
1. **Chaining (Linked List)** – Multiple entries at the same index are stored as a **linked list**.
2. **Tree-based Buckets (Java 8+)** – If the linked list grows **beyond 8 nodes**, it is converted into a **Red-Black Tree** for better performance.

---

## **🔹 HashMap Resizing**
- The default capacity of a `HashMap` is **16**.
- When the size **exceeds 75% of the capacity** (`load factor = 0.75`), the `HashMap` **doubles in size** (16 → 32 → 64) and **rehashes** all entries.

---

## **🔹 Performance Complexity**
| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case (Many Collisions) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `put()` | **O(1)** | **O(n) (if linked list grows long)** |
| `get()` | **O(1)** | **O(log n) (if tree-based bucket)** |
| `remove()` | **O(1)** | **O(log n)** |

---

## **🔹 Summary**
- **Uses an array of linked lists** (or Red-Black trees for large collisions).
- **Hashing and index computation** determine bucket placement.
- **Collisions are handled** using chaining and trees.
- **Resizing occurs** when the load factor exceeds 0.75.

# **Is Java Pass-by-Value or Pass-by-Reference?**  

### **🔹 Short Answer:**  
Java is **always pass-by-value**, but for objects, the value passed is a **reference to the object** (not the actual object itself).  

---

### **🔹 Understanding Pass-by-Value in Java**  
When you pass a variable to a method in Java, a **copy of the variable's value** is passed. Changes made inside the method **do not** affect the original variable outside the method.

#### **Example 1: Passing Primitives (Pass-by-Value)**
```java
public class PassByValueExample {
    public static void modifyValue(int num) {
        num = 20;  // Changing local copy
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        modifyValue(a);
        System.out.println(a);  // Output: 10 (original value remains unchanged)
    }
}
```
✅ Here, `num` gets a **copy** of `a`. Modifying `num` does not change `a`.

---

### **🔹 What About Objects?**
When you pass an object to a method, **the reference (memory address) is passed by value**, but the object itself is **not copied**.  
So, changes to the object's **fields** persist, but reassigning the reference inside the method does not affect the original reference.

#### **Example 2: Passing Object Reference (Reference Passed by Value)**
```java
class Dog {
    String name;
    
    Dog(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class PassByValueTest {
    public static void modifyDog(Dog dog) {
        dog.name = "Rocky";  // Modifies object field (will persist)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Bruno");
        modifyDog(myDog);
        System.out.println(myDog.name);  // Output: Rocky (Object's field modified)
    }
}
```
✅ The object's **field** is modified because the reference **points to the same object**.

#### **Example 3: Reassigning Object Reference (Original Reference Unchanged)**
```java
public class PassByValueExample {
    public static void modifyObject(Dog dog) {
        dog = new Dog("Charlie");  // Assigning new object (no effect outside)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Bruno");
        modifyObject(myDog);
        System.out.println(myDog.name);  // Output: Bruno (Reference remains unchanged)
    }
}
```
✅ Here, `dog = new Dog("Charlie")` **only changes the local reference**, so `myDog` still points to `"Bruno"`.

---

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**
1. **Primitives (int, double, etc.)** → **Pass-by-Value** (changes inside method do not affect original variable).
2. **Objects** → The **reference is passed by value**, meaning:
   - Modifying **object fields** affects the original object.
   - Reassigning a new object inside the method **does not** affect the original reference.

# **Why are Comparable and Comparator Interfaces Required in Java?**  

In Java, the **`Comparable`** and **`Comparator`** interfaces are required to define **custom sorting** mechanisms for objects. Since Java does not inherently know how to compare complex objects like `Employee`, `Student`, or `Book`, these interfaces allow developers to specify sorting logic.

---

## **🔹 1. `Comparable` Interface (Natural Ordering)**
- Used to define the **default sorting order** of objects.
- It is implemented in the class whose objects need to be sorted.
- Uses the **`compareTo(T obj)`** method.
- Modifies the class itself.

### **✅ Example of `Comparable`**
```java
import java.util.*;

class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {
    int id;
    String name;

    Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Sorting based on Employee ID (Natural Order)
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Employee other) {
        return this.id - other.id; // Ascending order
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return id + " - " + name;
    }
}

public class ComparableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(new Employee(3, "Alice"));
        list.add(new Employee(1, "Bob"));
        list.add(new Employee(2, "Charlie"));

        Collections.sort(list); // Uses compareTo method

        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```
### **📝 Output:**
```
[1 - Bob, 2 - Charlie, 3 - Alice]
```
✅ **`Comparable` is useful when there's a single natural sorting order, like sorting employees by ID.**

---

## **🔹 2. `Comparator` Interface (Custom Sorting)**
- Used when we need **multiple sorting options**.
- Does **not** modify the original class.
- Uses the **`compare(T obj1, T obj2)`** method.

### **✅ Example of `Comparator`**
```java
import java.util.*;

class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;

    Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return id + " - " + name;
    }
}

// Comparator to sort employees by Name
class NameComparator implements Comparator<Employee> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) {
        return e1.name.compareTo(e2.name);
    }
}

public class ComparatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(new Employee(3, "Alice"));
        list.add(new Employee(1, "Bob"));
        list.add(new Employee(2, "Charlie"));

        // Sort by Name using Comparator
        Collections.sort(list, new NameComparator());

        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```
### **📝 Output:**
```
[3 - Alice, 1 - Bob, 2 - Charlie]
```
✅ **`Comparator` is useful when multiple sorting criteria are needed, like sorting by Name instead of ID.**

---

## **🔹 When to Use `Comparable` vs `Comparator`?**
| Feature           | `Comparable` | `Comparator` |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Sorting Logic | Defined inside the class | Defined outside the class |
| Number of Sorting Criteria | Only one (natural order) | Multiple sorting options |
| Affects Class Structure? | Yes | No |
| Method Used | `compareTo(T obj)` | `compare(T obj1, T obj2)` |
| Example Usage | Sorting Employees by ID | Sorting Employees by Name, Age, etc. |

---

## **🔹 Key Takeaways**
- `Comparable` → Used for **default sorting (natural order)**, modifies the class.
- `Comparator` → Used for **custom sorting (multiple criteria)**, does **not** modify the class.
- `Collections.sort()` or `TreeSet`, `TreeMap` use these interfaces for sorting.

# **What are the Difference Between `Comparable` and `Comparator` in Java**  

Both **`Comparable`** and **`Comparator`** interfaces are used to define sorting logic for objects in Java, but they have key differences.

---

## **🔹 1. Comparable Interface (`java.lang.Comparable<T>`)**
- Used to define **natural sorting order**.
- Implemented within the class itself.
- Uses the **`compareTo(T obj)`** method.
- **Modifies the original class**.

### **✅ Example of `Comparable` (Sorting Employees by ID)**
```java
import java.util.*;

class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {
    int id;
    String name;

    Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Sorting based on Employee ID (Natural Order)
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Employee other) {
        return this.id - other.id; // Ascending order
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return id + " - " + name;
    }
}

public class ComparableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(new Employee(3, "Alice"));
        list.add(new Employee(1, "Bob"));
        list.add(new Employee(2, "Charlie"));

        Collections.sort(list); // Uses compareTo method

        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```
### **📝 Output:**
```
[1 - Bob, 2 - Charlie, 3 - Alice]
```
✅ **Best for default sorting when a single ordering is needed (e.g., sorting Employees by ID).**

---

## **🔹 2. Comparator Interface (`java.util.Comparator<T>`)**
- Used for **custom sorting logic**.
- Implemented **outside** the class.
- Uses the **`compare(T obj1, T obj2)`** method.
- Does **not modify the original class**.

### **✅ Example of `Comparator` (Sorting Employees by Name)**
```java
import java.util.*;

class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;

    Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return id + " - " + name;
    }
}

// Comparator to sort employees by Name
class NameComparator implements Comparator<Employee> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) {
        return e1.name.compareTo(e2.name);
    }
}

public class ComparatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(new Employee(3, "Alice"));
        list.add(new Employee(1, "Bob"));
        list.add(new Employee(2, "Charlie"));

        // Sort by Name using Comparator
        Collections.sort(list, new NameComparator());

        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```
### **📝 Output:**
```
[3 - Alice, 1 - Bob, 2 - Charlie]
```
✅ **Useful when multiple sorting criteria are needed (e.g., sorting by Name instead of ID).**

---

## **🔹 Key Differences Between `Comparable` and `Comparator`**
| Feature          | `Comparable` | `Comparator` |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Package | `java.lang` | `java.util` |
| Purpose | Defines **natural sorting order** | Defines **custom sorting order** |
| Implementation | Implemented **inside the class** | Implemented **outside the class** |
| Method | `compareTo(T obj)` | `compare(T obj1, T obj2)` |
| Modifies Class? | **Yes** (modifies the class) | **No** (keeps the class unchanged) |
| Number of Sorting Criteria | Only **one** sorting logic | Can define **multiple** sorting logics |
| Example Usage | Sorting by Employee ID | Sorting by Employee Name, Age, etc. |
| Used In | `TreeSet`, `TreeMap`, `Collections.sort()` | `Collections.sort()` with custom sorting |

---

## **🔹 When to Use What?**
- ✅ **Use `Comparable` when a single, natural ordering is required (e.g., sorting by ID).**
- ✅ **Use `Comparator` when multiple sorting options are needed (e.g., sorting by Name, Age, Salary).**

# **⚡ Explain Equals and HashCode Contract in Java**  

In Java, **`equals()`** and **`hashCode()`** methods are used for object comparison and hashing-based collections (like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `HashTable`). These methods must follow a strict **contract** to ensure correctness.  

---

## **🔹 The Contract Between `equals()` and `hashCode()`**  
### ✅ **1. If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, then their `hashCode()` must be the same.**
- If `obj1.equals(obj2) == true`, then `obj1.hashCode() == obj2.hashCode()`.  
- This ensures that equal objects will be stored in the same hash bucket in `HashMap` or `HashSet`.

### ❌ **2. If two objects have the same `hashCode()`, they are NOT necessarily equal.**  
- Different objects **can** have the same hash code due to **hash collisions**.  
- Example: `"FB".hashCode() == "Ea".hashCode()` (both return **2236**, but they are different Strings).  

### ✅ **3. If `equals()` is overridden, `hashCode()` must also be overridden.**
- If not, objects may behave incorrectly in hash-based collections.

### ✅ **4. The `hashCode()` method should consistently return the same value for the same object (unless modified).**
- Example: If you call `hashCode()` on an object multiple times, it should return the same value, **as long as the object’s fields haven’t changed**.

---

## **🔹 Implementation Example**
### **✅ Example of Proper `equals()` and `hashCode()` Implementation**
```java
import java.util.Objects;

class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;

    Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Overriding equals() method
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Employee employee = (Employee) obj;
        return id == employee.id && Objects.equals(name, employee.name);
    }

    // Overriding hashCode() method
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(id, name);
    }
}

public class EqualsHashCodeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee(1, "Alice");
        Employee e2 = new Employee(1, "Alice");

        System.out.println(e1.equals(e2)); // ✅ true
        System.out.println(e1.hashCode() == e2.hashCode()); // ✅ true

        // Using in a HashSet
        java.util.HashSet<Employee> set = new java.util.HashSet<>();
        set.add(e1);
        set.add(e2);
        System.out.println(set.size()); // ✅ 1 (as both objects are considered equal)
    }
}
```
### **📝 Output:**
```
true
true
1
```
✅ **Since `equals()` and `hashCode()` are properly implemented, duplicate objects are not stored in `HashSet`.**

---

## **🔹 What Happens If `hashCode()` is Not Overridden?**
If `hashCode()` is not overridden, objects that are logically equal (`equals() == true`) might have different hash codes, leading to incorrect behavior in hash-based collections.

### **Example: Wrong Implementation (Only `equals()` Overridden)**
```java
class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;

    Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Employee employee = (Employee) obj;
        return id == employee.id && Objects.equals(name, employee.name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee(1, "Alice");
        Employee e2 = new Employee(1, "Alice");

        java.util.HashSet<Employee> set = new java.util.HashSet<>();
        set.add(e1);
        set.add(e2);
        
        System.out.println(set.size()); // ❌ 2 (instead of 1)
    }
}
```
### **📝 Output:**
```
2
```
**🔴 Problem:** Even though `e1.equals(e2)` is `true`, `HashSet` considers them different because they have different hash codes.

---

## **🔹 Best Practices for `equals()` and `hashCode()`**
1. **Always override both together** to maintain consistency.
2. **Use `Objects.hash()`** in `hashCode()` for cleaner code.
3. **Avoid using mutable fields** in `hashCode()` to prevent inconsistency.
4. **Use `instanceof` carefully** inside `equals()` to support inheritance.

---

## **🔹 Summary Table**
| Feature | `equals()` | `hashCode()` |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Purpose | Compares object **contents** | Returns a **hash value** for an object |
| Must Override? | ✅ Yes, for custom object comparison | ✅ Yes, if `equals()` is overridden |
| Contract with Each Other | If `equals()` is `true`, then `hashCode()` **must be the same** | Two equal objects must have the same hash code |
| Used In | `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `ArrayList.contains()` | `HashSet`, `HashMap` (bucket placement) |
| Default Behavior (From `Object`) | Uses memory reference comparison (`==`) | Generates different hash codes for different objects |

---

## **🔹 Final Takeaway**
- Always **override `equals()` and `hashCode()` together**.
- Follow the **contract** to avoid issues in hash-based collections.
- Use **`Objects.hash()`** for simplicity in `hashCode()`.
- Never use **mutable fields** in `hashCode()`.

# **Is restricted access to derived method allowed?**
In Java, **restricted access to a derived (overridden) method is **not** allowed.** This means that when you override a method in a subclass, you **cannot** reduce the visibility of that method.  

### **🚫 Rule:**
> **You cannot override a method with a more restrictive access modifier than its superclass method.**  

---

## **✅ Allowed:**
You can **increase** or keep the same level of access when overriding a method.

```java
class Parent {
    protected void show() {  // Protected method
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    public void show() {  // Increased access to public (Allowed)
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }
}
```
✅ This is **allowed** because the access modifier is changed from `protected` → `public`, which is **more accessible**.

---

## **❌ Not Allowed:**
You **cannot** reduce visibility when overriding a method.

```java
class Parent {
    public void display() {  // Public method
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    private void display() {  // ❌ Error: Cannot reduce visibility
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }
}
```
🚨 **Error:**  
```
display() in Child cannot override display() in Parent
attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was public
```
🔴 This happens because the `Parent` class method is `public`, but the overridden method in `Child` is `private`, which is **more restrictive**.

---

## **🔹 Access Modifier Rules for Overriding**
| Parent Class Method Modifier | Allowed Modifiers in Child Class |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `private`                  | 🚫 Cannot be overridden |
| `default` (package-private) | `protected`, `public` |
| `protected`                 | `protected`, `public` |
| `public`                    | ✅ Only `public` (Cannot be restricted) |

---

## **🔹 Summary**
- **Cannot** reduce access while overriding a method.
- **Can** increase access (e.g., `protected` → `public`).
- **`private` methods** cannot be overridden (they are not inherited).
- Java enforces these rules to ensure that overridden methods **do not break encapsulation** or **reduce access unexpectedly**.

# **Can a Constructor be `final`, `static`, or `synchronized` in Java? Why or Why Not?**

#### **1. Can a Constructor be `final`?**
**No, a constructor cannot be `final` in Java.**  

##### **Reason:**
- The purpose of the `final` keyword is to **prevent method overriding** in subclasses.
- However, **constructors are not inherited**, so there is no concept of overriding them.
- Since overriding does not apply to constructors, making them `final` has no meaning and is **not allowed**.

##### **Example (Compilation Error)**:
```java
class Test {
    final Test() { // ❌ Compilation error
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. Can a Constructor be `static`?**
**No, a constructor cannot be `static` in Java.**  

##### **Reason:**
- `static` means that a method or variable belongs to the **class rather than an instance**.
- A constructor is responsible for **creating an instance of a class**, which contradicts the purpose of `static`.
- If a constructor were `static`, it would mean that it belongs to the class itself, but constructors are only called when creating instances.

##### **Alternative:**  
If you need a **static-like constructor behavior**, you can use a **static factory method**:
```java
class Test {
    private Test() { // Private constructor
        System.out.println("Private Constructor");
    }
    
    public static Test createInstance() { // Static factory method
        return new Test();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj = Test.createInstance(); // Correct way to "mimic" static constructor
    }
}
```

---

#### **3. Can a Constructor be `synchronized`?**
**No, a constructor cannot be `synchronized` in Java.**  

##### **Reason:**
- The purpose of `synchronized` is to control **concurrent access** to shared resources (mainly instance methods and blocks).
- A constructor is only used **during object creation**, and each thread calling `new ClassName()` gets a **completely new instance**.
- There is **no shared resource** to synchronize, so Java does not allow a `synchronized` constructor.

##### **Alternative:**  
If you need to **synchronize object creation**, you can synchronize the instance inside a **static factory method**:
```java
class Test {
    private static Test instance;

    private Test() { 
        System.out.println("Constructor called");
    }

    public static synchronized Test getInstance() { // Synchronizing instance creation
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Test();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj1 = Test.getInstance();
        Test obj2 = Test.getInstance();
    }
}
```
💡 This pattern is commonly used in **Singleton Design Pattern**.

---

### **Final Answer:**
🚫 **A constructor cannot be `final`, `static`, or `synchronized` in Java** because:
- `final` does not apply (constructors are not inherited).
- `static` contradicts instance creation.
- `synchronized` is unnecessary (each constructor call creates a separate instance).  

✅ However, **workarounds exist**, like using **static factory methods** for `static`-like behavior and **synchronized methods** for controlled instance creation.

# **Why Doesn’t Java Support Operator Overloading Like C++?**

Java **does not support operator overloading** like C++ because of **simplicity, readability, and maintainability**. Below are the key reasons why operator overloading is **intentionally omitted** from Java.

---

### **1. To Keep Java Simple & Readable**
One of Java’s main design goals was to **avoid complexity**.  
- In **C++**, operator overloading can make code **hard to understand** because the meaning of operators can change based on how they are overloaded.  
- In **Java**, an operator always has a **single, well-defined behavior**, making the code more predictable.

✅ **Example of confusion in C++**:
```cpp
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overloaded `+` operator
    Complex operator+(Complex const &obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(3, 4), c2(5, 6);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  // `+` works differently than primitive addition!
}
```
- The `+` operator works for both **integers and Complex numbers**, but its behavior changes, which can be **confusing**.

🚫 In Java, **all operators work consistently**, making the code easier to read and maintain.

---

### **2. To Avoid Unexpected Bugs & Misuse**
- In **C++**, developers can overload operators in **unexpected ways**, leading to **confusing and hard-to-debug issues**.
- Java's **designers deliberately avoided** operator overloading to **reduce unexpected behavior**.

✅ **Example of misuse in C++**:
```cpp
class Test {
public:
    bool operator==(const Test &other) {
        return true;  // Always returns true (BAD PRACTICE!)
    }
};
```
- The `==` operator **should compare object equality**, but an overloaded version might **always return true**, leading to incorrect results.

🚫 **Java prevents this issue** by enforcing `equals()` and `hashCode()` instead of allowing `==` to be overloaded.

---

### **3. Ensuring Consistent Performance**
- In **C++**, overloaded operators can sometimes be **less efficient** than built-in operators.
- Since Java is designed with **runtime efficiency** in mind, operator overloading was **removed** to avoid unnecessary performance issues.

---

### **4. Java Encourages Method-Based Approach Instead**
Instead of **operator overloading**, Java encourages **explicit methods** like `add()`, `compareTo()`, and `equals()`, making the operations more **readable**.

✅ **Java alternative for C++ operator overloading**:
```java
class Complex {
    int real, imag;

    public Complex(int r, int i) {
        this.real = r;
        this.imag = i;
    }

    public Complex add(Complex c) {  // Instead of overloading `+`
        return new Complex(this.real + c.real, this.imag + c.imag);
    }

    public String toString() {
        return real + " + " + imag + "i";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Complex c1 = new Complex(3, 4);
        Complex c2 = new Complex(5, 6);
        Complex c3 = c1.add(c2);  // Explicit method instead of `+`
        System.out.println(c3);   // Output: 8 + 10i
    }
}
```
🚀 **Benefits**:
- The method `add()` makes the intention **clear**.
- No confusion about how `+` should work.
- Better readability and maintainability.

---

### **5. Java Has Limited Operator Overloading for Strings**
Although **Java does not support full operator overloading**, it **partially supports** it for **string concatenation (`+`)**:
```java
String s = "Hello" + " World"; // Allowed in Java
```
However, this is a special case implemented at the compiler level, **not actual operator overloading**.

---

### **Conclusion**
🚫 **Java does not support operator overloading** because:
1. **Simplicity & Readability** – Prevents confusing operator behavior.  
2. **Avoids Bugs & Misuse** – Eliminates unexpected results from overloaded operators.  
3. **Ensures Consistent Performance** – Avoids inefficient implementations.  
4. **Encourages Explicit Methods** – Uses methods like `add()`, `equals()`, `compareTo()` instead of overloading.  
5. **Limited Support for String Concatenation** – Java only allows `+` for `String` types as a special case.  

✅ Instead of operator overloading, Java provides **well-defined methods**, making the language more **maintainable and predictable**! 🚀

# **Does Extending `Object` Class Imply Multiple Inheritance in Java?**  

No, **Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes**, even though every class in Java extends `Object` and can also extend another class. The key reason is **single class inheritance** and the way Java’s inheritance model works.

---

### **Understanding Inheritance in Java**
1. **Every class in Java implicitly extends `Object` (except `Object` itself).**  
2. **Java supports single inheritance**, meaning a class can only extend **one other class** explicitly.  
3. Since Java does **not** allow extending multiple classes, **multiple inheritance of classes is not applicable**.

---

### **Why This is Not Multiple Inheritance?**
#### **1️⃣ `Object` is the Root of All Classes**
Even if a class extends another class, it **still indirectly extends `Object`**.  
✅ Example:
```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("A");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("B");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B obj = new B();
        obj.show();   // Inherited from A
        obj.display(); // Defined in B
    }
}
```
- Here, `B` extends `A`, but **both `A` and `B` still extend `Object` implicitly**.
- However, **B only directly inherits from A**, not from multiple classes.

---

#### **2️⃣ Java Uses a Single Inheritance Model**
Unlike C++, Java does **not** allow a class to extend multiple classes.  
🚫 **Example (Not Allowed in Java)**:
```java
class A {}
class B {}

// ERROR: Cannot extend multiple classes
class C extends A, B {}  
```
- Java does **not** allow a class to inherit from both `A` and `B`.

---

#### **3️⃣ Object Methods Are Inherited, Not Multiple Classes**
When a class extends another class, it **inherits only from that class**, and all classes eventually inherit from `Object`.  
✅ **Example with `toString()` method from `Object`**:
```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    @Override
    public String toString() {  // Overriding from Object
        return "Class B";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B obj = new B();
        System.out.println(obj.toString());  // Uses Object's toString()
    }
}
```
- Here, `B` **only extends `A`**, but it **still gets `Object` methods like `toString()`**.
- This does **not** mean Java supports **multiple inheritance**.

---

### **How Java Handles the Problem of Multiple Inheritance?**
Java **avoids multiple inheritance of classes** to prevent ambiguity but provides:  
1. **Interfaces with default methods** to allow multiple inheritance of behavior.
2. **Composition (Has-A relationship)** as an alternative to multiple inheritance.

✅ **Example Using Interfaces (Allowed in Java)**:
```java
interface X {
    void methodX();
}

interface Y {
    void methodY();
}

class A implements X, Y {  // Allowed in Java
    public void methodX() {
        System.out.println("X method");
    }

    public void methodY() {
        System.out.println("Y method");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A obj = new A();
        obj.methodX();
        obj.methodY();
    }
}
```
- **Multiple inheritance of behavior is possible via interfaces**.
- **Multiple inheritance of classes is NOT possible**.

---

### **Conclusion**
❌ **Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes**.  
✅ Every class **implicitly** extends `Object`, but a class can **only extend one other class explicitly**.  
✅ **Java solves multiple inheritance issues using interfaces and composition** instead.  

Thus, **Java’s inheritance model ensures simplicity, avoids ambiguity, and maintains code clarity**. 🚀

# **Why is Multiple Inheritance Not Allowed in Java, but Interfaces Can Have Multiple Inheritance?**  

Java does **not** support multiple inheritance of classes, but it **allows multiple inheritance of interfaces**. This is mainly to avoid **ambiguity problems** while still allowing code reusability. Let's break this down in detail.

---

## **1️⃣ Why Multiple Inheritance of Classes is Not Allowed?**  

### **❌ Diamond Problem (Ambiguity Issue)**
If a class could inherit from multiple classes, it could lead to **method ambiguity** when both parent classes have the same method.

🚫 **Example (If Java Allowed Multiple Inheritance)**:
```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("A");
    }
}

class B {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("B");
    }
}

// ERROR: Java does not allow multiple class inheritance
class C extends A, B { 
    // Which show() method should C inherit? A's or B's?
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.show();  // Ambiguity: A's or B's method?
    }
}
```
❌ **Problem:** Java wouldn’t know whether to use `A.show()` or `B.show()`, causing confusion.  
✅ **Solution in Java:** Java **only allows single class inheritance** to prevent this.

---

### **❌ Complexity and Maintenance Issues**
- If multiple classes were inherited, resolving dependencies and maintaining the **class hierarchy** would become complex.
- Changes in one parent class could **break the entire hierarchy**, making debugging harder.
- Java prioritizes **code simplicity and readability**, so it restricts multiple class inheritance.

---

## **2️⃣ Why is Multiple Inheritance Allowed for Interfaces?**
Java **allows multiple inheritance of interfaces** because interfaces **only define method signatures (without implementation, before Java 8)**. This avoids the ambiguity that arises in **multiple class inheritance**.

✅ **Example of Multiple Interface Inheritance**:
```java
interface X {
    void methodX();
}

interface Y {
    void methodY();
}

// Class A implements both interfaces
class A implements X, Y {
    public void methodX() {
        System.out.println("X method");
    }

    public void methodY() {
        System.out.println("Y method");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A obj = new A();
        obj.methodX();  // No ambiguity
        obj.methodY();
    }
}
```
👉 **Why does this work?**
- `X` and `Y` only **define method contracts**, not implementations.
- `A` **provides its own implementation**, so there's **no ambiguity**.

---

### **3️⃣ What About Default Methods in Interfaces (Java 8)?**
Before Java 8, interfaces **only contained abstract methods**, avoiding implementation conflicts.  
But in **Java 8**, interfaces introduced **default methods**, which **can have implementations**.  

💡 **How does Java solve ambiguity in default methods?**
If two interfaces **have the same default method**, the implementing class **must override it**.

✅ **Example (Java 8 Default Methods with Conflict Resolution)**:
```java
interface A {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("A's show method");
    }
}

interface B {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("B's show method");
    }
}

// Class C implements both interfaces
class C implements A, B {
    // Resolving ambiguity
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("C's own show method");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.show();  // C's method overrides default methods from interfaces
    }
}
```
👉 **Java forces you to override conflicting default methods** to avoid ambiguity.

---

## **🔹 Summary**
| Feature | Multiple Inheritance of Classes | Multiple Inheritance of Interfaces |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Allowed?** | ❌ Not Allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| **Reason** | Avoids **ambiguity (diamond problem)** and **complexity** | Interfaces only provide **method signatures** (before Java 8) |
| **Conflicts?** | Causes confusion when two parent classes have the same method | Java **forces the child class to override** conflicting default methods (Java 8+) |
| **Solution?** | Use **composition** (`Has-A` relationship) | Use **interfaces** with multiple inheritance |

---

## **🚀 Conclusion**
- **Java restricts multiple class inheritance** to avoid **ambiguity and complexity**.  
- **Interfaces allow multiple inheritance** because they only define method contracts.  
- **With Java 8 default methods, Java enforces conflict resolution** by requiring explicit overrides.  

👉 **Java’s approach ensures code clarity, maintainability, and flexibility without the drawbacks of multiple class inheritance!** 🚀


# **Can We Override a Static Method in Java?**  

No, **we cannot override static methods in Java**. However, we **can redefine them in a subclass**, which is known as **method hiding**, not overriding.  

---

## **🔹 Why Can't Static Methods Be Overridden?**
1. **Static methods belong to the class, not to an instance**.
   - Method overriding in Java is based on **runtime polymorphism (dynamic method dispatch)**, which requires an object instance.
   - Since static methods are associated with the **class**, they don’t participate in dynamic method dispatch.
  
2. **Static methods are resolved at compile-time**.
   - Unlike instance methods, which are resolved at **runtime** based on the actual object type, static methods are resolved **at compile-time** based on the reference type.

---

## **🔹 What Happens When We "Override" a Static Method? (Method Hiding)**
If a subclass defines a static method with the **same signature** as a static method in the parent class, the **parent method is hidden, not overridden**.

✅ **Example of Method Hiding:**
```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() {  // This hides the Parent's show() method, not overrides it
        System.out.println("Static method in Child");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        p.show();  // Output: "Static method in Parent" (Method hiding, not overriding)

        Child c = new Child();
        c.show();  // Output: "Static method in Child"
    }
}
```
🔍 **Explanation:**
- `p.show();` calls `Parent`'s `show()` because **static methods are bound at compile-time**.
- `c.show();` calls `Child`'s `show()` because `c` is explicitly of type `Child`.

---

## **🔹 Key Differences: Method Overriding vs. Method Hiding**
| Feature | Method Overriding | Method Hiding |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Method Type** | Instance method | Static method |
| **Resolution Time** | Runtime (dynamic binding) | Compile-time (static binding) |
| **Inheritance Behavior** | Child method **replaces** the parent method | Child method **hides** the parent method |
| **Reference Behavior** | Based on actual object type | Based on reference type |

---

## **🔹 What If We Remove `static` from One of the Methods?**
If the method in the parent class is **static**, but the method in the child class is **non-static**, or vice versa, Java will throw a **compilation error**.

❌ **Invalid Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {  // Static method in Parent
        System.out.println("Parent's static method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void show() {  // ERROR: Cannot override static method as non-static
        System.out.println("Child's instance method");
    }
}
```
🔴 **Compilation Error:**  
`show() in Child cannot override show() in Parent; overridden method is static`

---

## **🔹 Can We Call a Static Method Using an Object?**
Yes, but it's **not recommended** since static methods belong to a class, not an object.

✅ **Example:**
```java
class Example {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static method called");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        obj.display();  // Works but gives a warning: should be called as Example.display()
    }
}
```
✔ **Better Way:** `Example.display();` (Call directly on the class)

---

## **🚀 Conclusion**
- **Static methods cannot be overridden**; they can only be **hidden** in subclasses.
- Method hiding follows **compile-time binding**, whereas method overriding follows **runtime polymorphism**.
- Calling a static method on an instance **works but is not recommended**.

📌 **Best Practice:** Always call static methods using the **class name**, not an object. 🚀

# **What Happens If a Class Implements Two Interfaces with the Same Default Method in Java?**  

If a class implements **two interfaces** that have the **same default method**, Java will throw a **compilation error** due to ambiguity. The compiler won’t know which method to call.  

---

### **🔹 Example of Conflict**
```java
interface InterfaceA {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("InterfaceA's show method");
    }
}

interface InterfaceB {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("InterfaceB's show method");
    }
}

class MyClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();  // Compilation error: show() is ambiguous
    }
}
```
🔴 **Compilation Error:**  
`class MyClass inherits unrelated defaults for show() from types InterfaceA and InterfaceB`

---

### **🔹 How to Resolve the Conflict?**
There are **two ways** to resolve this issue:

### **1️⃣ Override the Default Method in the Class**
You can **override** the conflicting method in your class and provide your own implementation.
```java
class MyClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
    @Override
    public void show() {  // Resolving the conflict by overriding
        System.out.println("Overridden method in MyClass");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();  // Output: Overridden method in MyClass
    }
}
```
✔ **This approach ensures clarity** and allows you to define custom behavior.

---

### **2️⃣ Specify Which Interface's Method to Use**
If you want to use a specific interface’s default method, you can **explicitly call it using `InterfaceName.super.methodName()`**.

```java
class MyClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        InterfaceA.super.show();  // Explicitly calling InterfaceA's method
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();  // Output: InterfaceA's show method
    }
}
```
✔ **This approach allows you to select a specific implementation from an interface.**

---

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**
1. **Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes** but allows it for interfaces.
2. If two interfaces provide the **same default method**, a class implementing both **must resolve the conflict** by:
   - **Overriding the method** or
   - **Explicitly calling a specific interface's method** using `InterfaceName.super.methodName()`.
3. This mechanism ensures **better control and avoids ambiguity** while supporting multiple inheritance for behavior (interfaces).

🚀 **Best Practice:** Always resolve conflicts explicitly to make the code readable and maintainable.

# **What is method hiding, and how does it differ from method overriding?**
### **Method Hiding vs. Method Overriding in Java**  

Method **hiding** and **overriding** both involve redefining methods in a subclass, but they behave differently based on whether the method is **static** or **non-static**.

---

## **🔹 Method Overriding (For Instance Methods)**
**Overriding** occurs when a **subclass provides a new implementation** for a **non-static (instance) method** that is already defined in the **superclass**.

### **Key Characteristics of Overriding**
✔ The method must have the **same name, return type, and parameters** as in the superclass.  
✔ The method **cannot have a more restrictive access modifier** than the overridden method.  
✔ The method in the subclass **is dynamically bound (runtime polymorphism).**  

### **Example of Overriding**
```java
class Parent {
    void show() { // Instance method
        System.out.println("Parent's show()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Child's show()");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child(); // Upcasting
        obj.show();  // Output: Child's show() (Dynamic method dispatch)
    }
}
```
✅ **Method calls are resolved at runtime (dynamic binding).**  
✅ **Method execution is determined by the actual object type (Child), not the reference type (Parent).**

---

## **🔹 Method Hiding (For Static Methods)**
**Method hiding** happens when a **subclass defines a static method** with the **same signature** as a static method in the **superclass**. Instead of overriding, the subclass **hides** the superclass method.

### **Key Characteristics of Method Hiding**
✔ The method in the superclass must be **static**.  
✔ The method in the subclass must also be **static**.  
✔ Method hiding does **not support runtime polymorphism** (static binding instead).  

### **Example of Method Hiding**
```java
class Parent {
    static void show() { // Static method
        System.out.println("Parent's static show()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() { // Hiding Parent's static method
        System.out.println("Child's static show()");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        obj.show();  // Output: Parent's static show() (Static binding)

        Child.show(); // Output: Child's static show()
    }
}
```
❌ **Unlike overriding, method calls are resolved at compile time (static binding).**  
❌ **The method executed is determined by the reference type, not the object type.**

---

## **🔹 Key Differences Between Method Hiding and Overriding**

| Feature             | Method Overriding | Method Hiding |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Method Type**    | Instance method (non-static) | Static method |
| **Binding Type**   | Dynamic (Runtime Polymorphism) | Static (Compile-time) |
| **Determined By**  | Object type (Actual instance) | Reference type |
| **Access via Superclass Reference** | Calls overridden method in subclass | Calls superclass method |
| **Use of `@Override` Annotation** | Allowed | Not applicable |

---

## **🔹 Conclusion**
- **Overriding** is used to achieve **runtime polymorphism**, where a method in a subclass provides a new implementation of an instance method from a superclass.
- **Method hiding** occurs when a **static method** in a subclass has the **same signature** as a static method in the superclass, but **it does not participate in polymorphism**.

🚀 **Best Practice:** Avoid method hiding unless necessary, as it can lead to confusion in code behavior.

# **Can an Interface Implement Another Interface in Java?**  
**No, an interface cannot "implement" another interface in Java, but it can "extend" another interface.**  

---

## **🔹 Extending an Interface in Java**  
In Java, one interface **can extend** another using the `extends` keyword.  
- Unlike classes, interfaces can extend **multiple** interfaces (i.e., multiple inheritance is allowed for interfaces).  
- A child interface **inherits all the abstract methods** and **default methods** from the parent interface.  

---

### **✅ Example: Interface Extending Another Interface**
```java
interface A {
    void methodA();
}

interface B extends A {  // B extends A
    void methodB();
}

class MyClass implements B {  // MyClass must implement both methodA() and methodB()
    public void methodA() {
        System.out.println("Method A implemented");
    }

    public void methodB() {
        System.out.println("Method B implemented");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.methodA();  // Output: Method A implemented
        obj.methodB();  // Output: Method B implemented
    }
}
```
✔ **`B` extends `A`**, so any class that implements `B` must implement all methods from `A` and `B`.  

---

## **🔹 Multiple Interface Inheritance (Extending Multiple Interfaces)**
Java **allows multiple inheritance for interfaces**, meaning an interface can extend multiple interfaces.

### **✅ Example: Multiple Interface Inheritance**
```java
interface A {
    void methodA();
}

interface B {
    void methodB();
}

interface C extends A, B {  // Multiple inheritance for interfaces
    void methodC();
}

class MyClass implements C {  // Must implement all methods
    public void methodA() {
        System.out.println("Method A implemented");
    }

    public void methodB() {
        System.out.println("Method B implemented");
    }

    public void methodC() {
        System.out.println("Method C implemented");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.methodA();
        obj.methodB();
        obj.methodC();
    }
}
```
✔ **Interface `C` extends both `A` and `B`**, so `MyClass` must implement all methods from `A`, `B`, and `C`.

---

## **🔹 Key Differences: Extending vs. Implementing**
| Feature                | Extending an Interface (`extends`) | Implementing an Interface (`implements`) |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Used By**            | Interfaces                     | Classes                        |
| **Keyword**            | `extends`                      | `implements`                   |
| **Multiple Inheritance?** | ✅ Yes (can extend multiple interfaces) | ❌ No (class can implement multiple interfaces but cannot extend multiple classes) |
| **Abstract Methods**   | Inherited in child interface   | Must be implemented in class |

---

## **🔹 Conclusion**
✔ **An interface can extend another interface** (or multiple interfaces) using `extends`.  
✔ **A class implements an interface** using `implements` and must define all inherited methods.  
✔ **Multiple inheritance is allowed for interfaces** but not for classes.  

🚀 **Best Practice:** Use interface extension to create flexible and reusable designs while keeping dependencies minimal.

# **What happens if we try to access a private method from a subclass?**
If we try to access a **private** method from a subclass in Java, we will get a **compilation error** because **private methods are not inherited** by subclasses.

### **Explanation:**
- **Private methods** are accessible **only within the same class** where they are defined.
- **They are not visible** to subclasses or any other classes.
- Even if a subclass tries to access a private method, it will not be able to call it directly.

### **Example - Attempting to Access a Private Method in a Subclass**
```java
class Parent {
    private void show() {
        System.out.println("Private method in Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        // show(); // This will cause a compilation error!
        System.out.println("Trying to access a private method from subclass");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.display();
    }
}
```
### **Error:**
```
error: cannot find symbol
        show();  // Not accessible
        ^
  symbol:   method show()
  location: class Child
```
---

### **How to Work Around This?**
Since private methods are not inherited, we have two options:
1. **Change the access modifier to `protected` or `public`** so that it can be accessed in the subclass.
2. **Use a public or protected method inside the parent class that calls the private method internally.**

#### **Solution 1: Use a `protected` method**
```java
class Parent {
    protected void show() {
        System.out.println("Protected method in Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        show(); // Now accessible
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.display();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Protected method in Parent class
```

#### **Solution 2: Indirect Access through a Public Method**
```java
class Parent {
    private void show() {
        System.out.println("Private method in Parent class");
    }

    public void accessShow() {
        show(); // Indirect access
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        accessShow(); // Calls the public method that internally calls the private method
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.display();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Private method in Parent class
```

### **Conclusion**
- Directly accessing a private method from a subclass **is not possible**.
- Use `protected` or `public` methods for controlled access.
- Alternatively, **use a public method in the parent class** to call the private method indirectly.

Let me know if you need further clarification! 🚀

# **Can we extend multiple classes indirectly in Java by extending one class that extends another? How is it different from true multiple inheritance?**
Yes, we can **indirectly extend multiple classes in Java** by following a **hierarchical inheritance** approach where one class extends another, forming a chain. However, this is **not true multiple inheritance** like in C++, where a class can directly inherit from multiple classes.

---

## **Indirect Multiple Inheritance in Java (Single Inheritance Chain)**
In Java, a class can extend only **one** class at a time (`single inheritance`), but it can still inherit properties from multiple levels of a class hierarchy.

### **Example: Indirect Multiple Inheritance**
```java
class GrandParent {
    void grandParentMethod() {
        System.out.println("Grandparent method");
    }
}

class Parent extends GrandParent {
    void parentMethod() {
        System.out.println("Parent method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void childMethod() {
        System.out.println("Child method");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.grandParentMethod(); // Inherited from GrandParent
        obj.parentMethod();      // Inherited from Parent
        obj.childMethod();       // Defined in Child
    }
}
```

### **Output:**
```
Grandparent method
Parent method
Child method
```

#### **How it Works?**
- `Child` indirectly **inherits** from `GrandParent` through `Parent`.
- Even though `Child` does not directly extend `GrandParent`, it can still access its methods via `Parent`.

---

## **How is it Different from True Multiple Inheritance?**
In **true multiple inheritance** (like in C++), a class can inherit directly from multiple classes. However, Java **does not support multiple inheritance of classes** to avoid the **diamond problem** (ambiguity due to multiple paths of inheritance).

### **Example: True Multiple Inheritance in C++ (Not Possible in Java)**
```cpp
class A {
public:
    void show() { cout << "Class A" << endl; }
};

class B {
public:
    void show() { cout << "Class B" << endl; }
};

class C : public A, public B {
    // Ambiguity: C++ compiler does not know which `show()` to call
};

int main() {
    C obj;
    obj.show(); // ERROR: Ambiguous method call
    return 0;
}
```
👉 In Java, this ambiguity is **avoided** by **not allowing multiple class inheritance**.

---

## **How to Achieve Multiple Inheritance in Java?**
Since Java **does not allow multiple inheritance through classes**, it provides **interfaces** as an alternative.

### **Example: Achieving Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces**
```java
interface A {
    void showA();
}

interface B {
    void showB();
}

class C implements A, B {  // Implements multiple interfaces
    public void showA() {
        System.out.println("Class A Method");
    }
    
    public void showB() {
        System.out.println("Class B Method");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.showA();
        obj.showB();
    }
}
```

### **Output:**
```
Class A Method
Class B Method
```

#### **Key Differences:**
| **Feature**                 | **Indirect Multiple Inheritance** | **True Multiple Inheritance** (Not in Java) |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Inheritance Type**         | Single inheritance chain        | Multiple direct parent classes |
| **Number of Superclasses**   | One at a time                   | Multiple at the same level    |
| **Code Ambiguity?**          | No                              | Yes, due to the diamond problem |
| **Method Overriding Conflicts?** | No                         | Yes, if multiple superclasses define the same method |
| **Achievable in Java?**      | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No (Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes) |
| **Alternative in Java**      | Interfaces (`implements`)       | Supported in C++, Python, etc. |

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Java allows indirect multiple inheritance** using **single inheritance chains** (one class extends another).
- **True multiple inheritance** is **not supported** in Java to avoid **ambiguity** and **complexity**.
- **Interfaces** provide a way to achieve **multiple inheritance-like behavior** in Java without the issues of multiple class inheritance.

# **What happens if an Object is no longer referenced but has a finalize() method? Will it be garbage collected?**
If an object is **no longer referenced** but has a **`finalize()`** method, it **may not be immediately garbage collected**. Here’s what happens step by step:

### **1. When an Object Becomes Unreachable**
- If an object has no references pointing to it, it **becomes eligible for garbage collection**.
- However, if the object overrides the **`finalize()`** method, the **garbage collector calls `finalize()` before actually removing the object**.

### **2. Execution of `finalize()`**
- The **`finalize()`** method gives the object a **last chance to perform cleanup** before it is removed.
- If **`finalize()` resurrects the object** by assigning `this` to a **static reference**, the object **is no longer eligible for garbage collection**.
- If the object is not resurrected, it **will be garbage collected in the next cycle**.

### **3. Is `finalize()` Guaranteed to Run?**
- **No.** The JVM **does not guarantee** that `finalize()` will always be executed.
- If the JVM exits before garbage collection occurs, `finalize()` **might never run**.
- The **order of execution** of `finalize()` is **not predictable**, and it may delay object destruction.

---

### **Example: What Happens When `finalize()` is Used?**
```java
class Test {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("finalize() called!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj = new Test();
        obj = null; // Object becomes eligible for GC

        System.gc(); // Suggests JVM to run garbage collection
        
        System.out.println("End of main method");
    }
}
```
#### **Possible Output (Not Guaranteed)**
```
End of main method
finalize() called!
```
**OR (if GC doesn't run in time):**
```
End of main method
```
---

### **4. Can We Prevent Garbage Collection in `finalize()`?**
Yes! If `finalize()` **assigns the object reference back to a variable**, the object **escapes garbage collection**.

#### **Example: Reviving an Object in `finalize()`**
```java
class Revive {
    static Revive instance;

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("finalize() called! Reviving object...");
        instance = this; // Reviving the object
    }
}

public class TestFinalize {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Revive obj = new Revive();
        obj = null; // Eligible for GC

        System.gc(); // Suggest garbage collection

        // Check if object was revived
        if (Revive.instance != null) {
            System.out.println("Object revived!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Object was garbage collected.");
        }
    }
}
```
#### **Possible Output:**
```
finalize() called! Reviving object...
Object revived!
```
Here, the object **escapes garbage collection** because `finalize()` assigns it to a static reference.

---

### **5. Why is `finalize()` Deprecated?**
Since **Java 9**, `finalize()` has been **deprecated** because:
1. **Unpredictability** – It is not guaranteed to run.
2. **Performance Issues** – It slows down garbage collection.
3. **Safer Alternatives Exist** – Use **`try-with-resources`** or **explicit cleanup methods** instead.

### **6. Best Alternative: Using `AutoCloseable` for Cleanup**
Instead of `finalize()`, we should use **`AutoCloseable`** to clean up resources explicitly.

#### **Example: Using `AutoCloseable` Instead of `finalize()`**
```java
class Resource implements AutoCloseable {
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using resource...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Resource closed!");
    }
}

public class TestResource {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Resource res = new Resource()) {
            res.use();
        } // `close()` is automatically called here
    }
}
```
#### **Output:**
```
Using resource...
Resource closed!
```
Here, **`close()`** ensures cleanup without relying on the unpredictable `finalize()`.

---

### **7. Summary**
| **Scenario** | **Does the Object Get Garbage Collected?** |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Object is unreferenced, no `finalize()` | ✅ Yes, garbage collected |
| Object is unreferenced, has `finalize()` | 🔄 `finalize()` runs first, then garbage collected (if not revived) |
| `finalize()` resurrects object (`this` assigned to static ref) | ❌ No, object survives |
| JVM exits before GC runs | ❌ `finalize()` might not run at all |
| Using `AutoCloseable` (`try-with-resources`) | ✅ Safer alternative, ensures proper cleanup |

---

### **Final Takeaway**
- If an **unreferenced object has `finalize()`**, the JVM **calls `finalize()` before deleting the object**.
- **If `finalize()` resurrects the object**, it **escapes garbage collection**.
- **`finalize()` is deprecated** in favor of **`AutoCloseable`** and explicit cleanup methods.
- Always prefer **try-with-resources (`AutoCloseable`)** instead of relying on `finalize()`.

# **Can an object be garbage collected while it is still reachable?**
No, an object **cannot** be garbage collected while it is still **strongly reachable** in Java. However, there are some exceptions where an object may be garbage collected even if it appears reachable under certain conditions.

---

### **1. Normally, a Reachable Object is Not Garbage Collected**
- In Java, an object is **only eligible for garbage collection when there are no strong references** pointing to it.
- If an object is still accessible by a running thread, it **remains in memory**.

#### **Example: Strongly Reachable Object (Not Collected)**
```java
class Test {
    int data = 10;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj = new Test(); // obj is reachable
        System.gc(); // Suggest garbage collection
        System.out.println("Object is still reachable: " + obj.data);
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Object is still reachable: 10
```
Here, `obj` is still referenced, so it **cannot be garbage collected**.

---

### **2. When Can a Reachable Object Be Garbage Collected?**
There are **some special cases** where an object might be garbage collected **even if it seems reachable**:

#### **Case 1: Objects with Weak or Soft References**
- Java provides **Weak References** and **Soft References** in `java.lang.ref` that allow objects to be garbage collected even if they are still referenced.

##### **WeakReference Example (Object Can Be Collected)**
```java
import java.lang.ref.WeakReference;

class Test {
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Object is garbage collected");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeakReference<Test> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(new Test());

        System.gc(); // Request garbage collection

        if (weakRef.get() == null) {
            System.out.println("Object is garbage collected");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Object is still reachable");
        }
    }
}
```
**Possible Output:**
```
Object is garbage collected
Object is garbage collected
```
- `WeakReference` objects **do not prevent garbage collection**, so the object can be **collected even if reachable through a weak reference**.

##### **SoftReference Example (Collected Only in Low Memory)**
```java
import java.lang.ref.SoftReference;

class Test {
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Object is garbage collected");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SoftReference<Test> softRef = new SoftReference<>(new Test());

        System.gc(); // Object may not be garbage collected immediately

        if (softRef.get() == null) {
            System.out.println("Object is garbage collected");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Object is still reachable");
        }
    }
}
```
- **Soft references** allow the object to stay in memory until JVM needs space.
- The object is collected **only if memory is low**.

---

#### **Case 2: Phantom References (Always Collectible)**
- **Phantom references** are used for **post-mortem cleanup**. The object **is always eligible for GC**, but can still be tracked.

---

#### **Case 3: Explicit `System.exit()` Before Object is Used**
If the JVM shuts down before an object is used, **garbage collection can remove objects even if reachable**.

```java
class Test {
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Object is garbage collected");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj = new Test();
        System.exit(0); // JVM exits, object is garbage collected
    }
}
```
- **No output** (JVM exits before printing).
- `obj` **can be garbage collected**, as JVM shutdown makes its reachability irrelevant.

---

#### **Case 4: Circular References in Legacy Java (Solved by GC)**
In **older Java versions**, circular references between objects **could cause memory leaks** if garbage collection was reference-count-based.

```java
class A {
    B b;
}

class B {
    A a;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A objA = new A();
        B objB = new B();

        objA.b = objB;
        objB.a = objA;

        objA = null;
        objB = null;

        System.gc(); // Both objects can be collected now
    }
}
```
- **Modern Java GCs** detect circular references and **collect them properly**.

---

### **Summary**
| **Scenario** | **Can Object Be Garbage Collected?** |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **Strong reference exists** | ❌ No, object is not collected |
| **WeakReference used** | ✅ Yes, object is collected |
| **SoftReference used** | 🔄 Maybe, collected only if memory is low |
| **PhantomReference used** | ✅ Yes, object is always eligible for GC |
| **System.exit() before use** | ✅ Yes, JVM shutdown forces cleanup |
| **Circular references** | ✅ Yes, modern GC detects and removes them |

---

### **Final Takeaway**
- **Normally, a reachable object cannot be garbage collected.**
- **Weak and soft references** allow objects to be collected even if reachable.
- **JVM shutdown (`System.exit()`) may cause premature garbage collection.**
- **Circular references are handled well in modern Java GC algorithms.**

# **Why should we avoid using finalize() for cleanup in Java?**
Using **`finalize()`** for cleanup in Java is **strongly discouraged** and has even been **deprecated** since **Java 9** due to several critical issues. Here’s why:

---

## **1. Unpredictability – No Guarantee of Execution**
- The **JVM does not guarantee** that `finalize()` will ever be called.
- If an object becomes eligible for garbage collection **but GC does not run**, `finalize()` will **never execute**.
- JVM **may delay execution** of `finalize()`, causing **resource leaks**.

🔴 **Example: Unpredictable Execution of `finalize()`**
```java
class Test {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("finalize() called!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Test(); // Object is eligible for GC immediately
        System.gc(); // Request GC, but it may not run immediately
        System.out.println("Main method finished");
    }
}
```
✅ **Possible Output 1:**
```
Main method finished
finalize() called!
```
❌ **Possible Output 2 (If GC does not run):**
```
Main method finished
```
🔹 `finalize()` **may or may not execute**, leading to **unreliable cleanup**.

---

## **2. Performance Issues – Slows Down Garbage Collection**
- Objects with `finalize()` **take longer** to be garbage collected.
- When an object is found to have `finalize()`, it is **moved to a special queue**.
- A **separate GC thread** must process this queue **before reclaiming memory**, increasing **GC overhead**.

🔴 **Example: Delayed Garbage Collection**
```java
class Test {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("finalize() called!");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000); // Simulating delay
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Test();
        System.gc(); // Request GC
        System.out.println("Main method finished");
    }
}
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Main method finished
(finalize() runs after ~5 seconds)
finalize() called!
```
🔹 The **finalization queue causes unnecessary delays**, impacting performance.

---

## **3. `finalize()` Can Resurrect Objects, Causing Memory Leaks**
- **If `finalize()` assigns the object reference to a static variable, the object becomes reachable again**.
- This **prevents it from being garbage collected**, causing **memory leaks**.

🔴 **Example: Object Resurrection**
```java
class Test {
    static Test instance;

    @Override
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Resurrecting object...");
        instance = this; // Resurrecting object
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj = new Test();
        obj = null; // Object eligible for GC

        System.gc(); // Request GC

        if (Test.instance != null) {
            System.out.println("Object was resurrected and not garbage collected!");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Resurrecting object...
Object was resurrected and not garbage collected!
```
🔹 Since `finalize()` **re-referenced the object**, it **escaped garbage collection**, leading to **memory leaks**.

---

## **4. Alternative Cleanup Methods Are Better**
Instead of `finalize()`, **Java provides better mechanisms** for resource management:

### ✅ **Use `try-with-resources` (`AutoCloseable`)**
The **best alternative** for closing resources like files, database connections, etc.
```java
class Resource implements AutoCloseable {
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using resource...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Resource closed!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Resource res = new Resource()) {
            res.use();
        } // `close()` is automatically called
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Using resource...
Resource closed!
```
🔹 **Ensures cleanup happens immediately, unlike `finalize()`**.

---

### ✅ **Use Explicit `close()` Methods**
If not using `AutoCloseable`, explicitly **call `close()`** in a `finally` block.
```java
class Resource {
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Resource manually closed!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resource res = new Resource();
        try {
            // Use resource
        } finally {
            res.close(); // Ensure cleanup
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Resource manually closed!
```
🔹 **Predictable cleanup without relying on GC**.

---

## **5. `finalize()` is Deprecated**
- **Java 9 onwards, `finalize()` is deprecated**.
- Java **discourages** its use due to all the issues mentioned.
- JVM will now **issue warnings** if `finalize()` is used.

---

## **Summary**
| **Issue** | **Why Avoid `finalize()`?** |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **Unpredictability** | `finalize()` may **never run** if GC doesn't execute. |
| **Performance Overhead** | Objects with `finalize()` take **longer to be garbage collected**. |
| **Resurrection Problems** | `finalize()` can **bring objects back to life**, causing **memory leaks**. |
| **Better Alternatives** | Use **`try-with-resources`** or **explicit `close()` methods** instead. |
| **Deprecated** | `finalize()` is officially **deprecated in Java 9+**. |

---

## **Final Takeaway**
🚫 **Never use `finalize()` for cleanup!** Instead:
✅ **Use `AutoCloseable` with `try-with-resources` for guaranteed cleanup.**  
✅ **Use explicit `close()` methods in a `finally` block if necessary.**

# **What is the difference between SoftReference, WeakReference, and PhantomReference in Java?**
In Java, **SoftReference**, **WeakReference**, and **PhantomReference** are types of **reference objects** that allow different levels of control over **garbage collection (GC)** behavior. They are part of the `java.lang.ref` package and are used to manage memory efficiently.

| **Garbage Collection Timing** | Cleared **only when JVM is low on memory** | Cleared **as soon as no strong references exist** | Cleared **only after finalize() has run** and before GC reclaims memory |
| **Use Case** | **Cache management** (e.g., image caching) | **Short-lived objects like Maps' keys** (e.g., WeakHashMap) | **Tracking object finalization** (e.g., cleaning up resources) |
| **Reference Availability Before GC** | Available **until JVM needs memory** | Available **until GC collects it** | **Never accessible**, even before GC runs |
| **Performance Impact** | Improves performance by delaying GC | Helps reduce memory leaks | Requires a **ReferenceQueue** for notification |
| **Example Scenario** | Caching **large objects** (images, data) | Weak references in **WeakHashMap** (e.g., keys that should be garbage collected) | **Post-mortem cleanup** after object is finalized |

---

## **1. SoftReference (Ideal for Caching)**
### ✅ **Objects are garbage collected only when memory is low.**
- **Used for implementing caches** where objects should be retained as long as enough memory is available.
- **Not collected immediately** after the object becomes unreachable.

### **Example: SoftReference in Action**
```java
import java.lang.ref.SoftReference;

class LargeData {
    private byte[] data = new byte[10 * 1024 * 1024]; // 10MB
}

public class SoftReferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SoftReference<LargeData> softRef = new SoftReference<>(new LargeData());

        System.gc(); // Suggest garbage collection

        if (softRef.get() != null) {
            System.out.println("Object is still available.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Object was garbage collected.");
        }
    }
}
```
**Possible Output:**
```
Object is still available.
```
**If memory is low:**
```
Object was garbage collected.
```
🔹 **Use Case:** Caching large objects like images, database query results, etc.

---

## **2. WeakReference (Used in WeakHashMap)**
### ✅ **Objects are garbage collected as soon as there are no strong references.**
- Ideal for **storing metadata or keys in `WeakHashMap`**.
- **GC removes objects as soon as they become unreachable**.

### **Example: WeakReference Behavior**
```java
import java.lang.ref.WeakReference;

class Data {
    private int value = 100;
}

public class WeakReferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeakReference<Data> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(new Data());

        System.gc(); // Request GC

        if (weakRef.get() != null) {
            System.out.println("Object is still available.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Object was garbage collected.");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output (Most Likely):**
```
Object was garbage collected.
```
🔹 **Use Case:**  
- Used in **WeakHashMap**, where keys are automatically removed when they are no longer strongly referenced.
- Helps **prevent memory leaks** in cache implementations.

### **Example: WeakHashMap Auto Removal**
```java
import java.util.WeakHashMap;

public class WeakHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeakHashMap<String, String> weakMap = new WeakHashMap<>();
        String key = new String("TemporaryKey"); // Weakly referenced key
        weakMap.put(key, "Value");

        key = null; // Key becomes unreachable
        System.gc(); // Request GC

        System.out.println("WeakHashMap: " + weakMap); // Should be empty if GC ran
    }
}
```
🔹 **When `GC` runs, the key-value pair is removed automatically**.

---

## **3. PhantomReference (For Object Finalization)**
### ✅ **Objects are never accessible through PhantomReference.**
- **Used for post-mortem cleanup tasks** (e.g., closing file handles, native resource cleanup).
- **Always requires a `ReferenceQueue`** to notify when an object is about to be collected.

### **Example: Using PhantomReference for Cleanup**
```java
import java.lang.ref.PhantomReference;
import java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue;

class Resource {
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Resource is being finalized.");
    }
}

public class PhantomReferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReferenceQueue<Resource> refQueue = new ReferenceQueue<>();
        PhantomReference<Resource> phantomRef = new PhantomReference<>(new Resource(), refQueue);

        System.gc(); // Request GC

        if (refQueue.poll() != null) {
            System.out.println("Object is ready for garbage collection.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Object is not yet finalized.");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output (Expected after GC runs):**
```
Resource is being finalized.
Object is ready for garbage collection.
```
🔹 **Use Case:** Used in **memory-sensitive applications** to clean up resources like file handles, sockets, etc.

---

## **Summary Table**
| **Reference Type**  | **When Is Object Collected?** | **Reference Available Before GC?** | **Common Use Cases** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **SoftReference**   | **Only if JVM is low on memory** | ✅ Yes (Until memory is needed) | **Caching large objects** (e.g., images, database results) |
| **WeakReference**   | **As soon as no strong references exist** | ✅ Yes (Until GC runs) | **WeakHashMap, short-lived metadata storage** |
| **PhantomReference** | **After finalize() runs, before memory is reclaimed** | ❌ No (Cannot be accessed) | **Post-mortem cleanup, resource management** |

---

## **When to Use Each Reference Type?**
| **Scenario** | **Best Reference Type** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Caching images, large objects | **SoftReference** |
| Storing metadata, map keys that should be auto-removed | **WeakReference** |
| Detecting object finalization for resource cleanup | **PhantomReference** |

---

## **Final Takeaway**
- **Use `SoftReference` for caching**, as objects stay until memory is needed.
- **Use `WeakReference` for weakly reachable objects**, like **WeakHashMap keys**.
- **Use `PhantomReference` for cleanup operations** when **finalization is required**.

# **What happens if a thread inside a synchronized block throws an exception? Will the lock be released?**
Yes, if a thread **inside a `synchronized` block throws an exception**, the **lock will be automatically released**.

---

## **Understanding Lock Behavior in Synchronized Blocks**
When a thread enters a **synchronized block or method**, it acquires a **monitor lock** on the object. This lock ensures that no other thread can enter another synchronized block on the **same object** until the lock is released.

However, if an **exception occurs** inside the synchronized block, the lock is **automatically released** when the thread **exits the block**, allowing other threads to proceed.

---

### **Example: Lock is Released on Exception**
```java
class SharedResource {
    public synchronized void process() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired the lock.");
        
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // This will cause an ArithmeticException
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " encountered an exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is exiting.");
    }
}

public class SynchronizedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Runnable task = () -> {
            resource.process();
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
### **Expected Output:**
```
Thread-1 acquired the lock.
Thread-1 encountered an exception: / by zero
Thread-1 is exiting.
Thread-2 acquired the lock.
Thread-2 encountered an exception: / by zero
Thread-2 is exiting.
```

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Thread-1 acquires the lock and encounters an exception.**
2. **Even though an exception occurs, the lock is automatically released.**
3. **Thread-2 is then able to acquire the lock and execute.**

---

## **What Happens if We Use a `finally` Block?**
If a **finally block** is present, it will always execute, ensuring resource cleanup before the lock is released.

```java
class SharedResource {
    public synchronized void process() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired the lock.");
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // Causes an exception
        } finally {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finally block executed.");
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is exiting.");
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Thread-1 acquired the lock.
Thread-1 finally block executed.
Thread-1 is exiting.
Thread-2 acquired the lock.
Thread-2 finally block executed.
Thread-2 is exiting.
```
🔹 **Even after an exception, the lock is released, and the `finally` block ensures any necessary cleanup.**

---

## **What About `synchronized` Methods?**
The same behavior applies to **synchronized methods**. If an exception occurs, the lock is **released before the exception propagates**.

```java
class SharedResource {
    public synchronized void process() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired the lock.");
        throw new RuntimeException("Simulated Exception");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> resource.process(), "Thread-1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> resource.process(), "Thread-2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```
### **Expected Output:**
```
Thread-1 acquired the lock.
Exception in thread "Thread-1" java.lang.RuntimeException: Simulated Exception
Thread-2 acquired the lock.
Exception in thread "Thread-2" java.lang.RuntimeException: Simulated Exception
```
🔹 **Thread-2 acquires the lock immediately after Thread-1 throws an exception, confirming that the lock was released.**

---

## **Conclusion**
| **Scenario** | **Will Lock Be Released?** | **Why?** |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Exception inside synchronized block** | ✅ Yes | JVM automatically releases the lock when the thread exits. |
| **Exception inside synchronized method** | ✅ Yes | Lock is released before the exception propagates. |
| **`finally` block present** | ✅ Yes | `finally` executes before the lock is released. |
| **Manually catching the exception** | ✅ Yes | Even if caught, the thread exits the block, releasing the lock. |

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Locks are always released when a thread exits a synchronized block/method, even if an exception occurs.**
- **Using a `finally` block is a good practice for cleanup.**
- **Handling exceptions inside synchronized blocks ensures thread stability.**

# **Why is String immutable in Java? What benefits does this provide?**
### **Why is `String` Immutable in Java?**
In Java, the `String` class is **immutable**, meaning **once a `String` object is created, it cannot be changed**. Any modification to a `String` results in a new object being created in memory.

This design choice was made to ensure **security, performance, caching efficiency, and thread safety**.

---

## **Benefits of String Immutability**
| **Reason** | **How It Helps?** |
|-----------|------------------|
| **1. Security** | Prevents security threats in sensitive operations (e.g., passwords, class loading, file paths). |
| **2. String Pool Optimization** | Enables the use of the **String Pool**, reducing memory consumption. |
| **3. Thread Safety** | Eliminates the need for synchronization, making `String` inherently thread-safe. |
| **4. Efficient HashCode Caching** | Hash codes are cached, improving performance for hash-based collections. |
| **5. Predictability** | Ensures consistency in APIs that rely on constant keys (e.g., network connections, database queries). |

---

## **1. Security – Prevents Unwanted Modifications**
If `String` were **mutable**, it could cause serious security vulnerabilities.

🔴 **Example: Compromised Security in Mutable String**
```java
class SecurityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String password = "securePassword123";
        authenticate(password);
        password = "hackedPassword"; // If String were mutable, this could alter authentication behavior!
    }

    static void authenticate(String password) {
        System.out.println("Authenticating user with: " + password);
    }
}
```
✅ **With immutable `String`, passwords remain unchanged**, ensuring data integrity.

---

## **2. String Pool Optimization – Saves Memory**
Since strings are **immutable**, Java optimizes memory usage by storing **string literals in the String Pool**.

🔵 **Example: String Pool Behavior**
```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Hello"; // Reuses the same object from the String Pool

System.out.println(s1 == s2); // Output: true (Both refer to the same memory location)
```
🚀 **Advantage:**  
- No need to create multiple copies of the same string.
- Saves memory by reusing existing string objects.

---

## **3. Thread Safety – No Synchronization Needed**
Immutable objects are **inherently thread-safe** because they **cannot be modified**.

🔴 **Example: Mutable String in Multi-threading (Unsafe)**
```java
class MutableString {
    StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder("Hello");

    void update() {
        str.append(" World");
    }
}
```
🔹 **If multiple threads modify `str`, race conditions may occur**.

✅ **Immutable Strings Avoid This Issue**
```java
class SafeString {
    final String str = "Hello";

    void update() {
        String newStr = str + " World"; // Creates a new object instead of modifying existing one
    }
}
```
🚀 **Benefit:** No need for explicit synchronization when using `String` across multiple threads.

---

## **4. Efficient HashCode Caching – Improves Performance**
- `String` overrides `hashCode()` and **caches the computed value**.
- This makes `String` highly efficient for use in **hash-based collections** like `HashMap` and `HashSet`.

🔵 **Example: Fast HashMap Lookups**
```java
String s1 = "key";
System.out.println(s1.hashCode()); // Hashcode is computed once and reused

HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(s1, 100);

System.out.println(map.get("key")); // Quick lookup using cached hashcode
```
🚀 **Advantage:** Faster retrieval in collections due to cached hashcode.

---

## **5. Predictability – Used in Keys and Identifiers**
Since `String` is used in:
- **Database queries**
- **File paths**
- **Network connections**
- **Class loading mechanisms**

Having **immutable strings** ensures **reliability** in these operations.

🔵 **Example: Immutable String in Database Query**
```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ";
query += "101"; // Creates a new object, original query is unchanged

executeQuery(query);
```
🚀 **Benefit:** Prevents accidental modifications to queries and file paths.

---

## **Conclusion**
| **Benefit** | **Why It Matters?** |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Security** | Prevents modification of sensitive data (passwords, file paths). |
| **String Pool** | Saves memory by reusing strings instead of creating new ones. |
| **Thread Safety** | No synchronization needed, making strings safe for multi-threading. |
| **Performance** | Caches `hashCode()`, speeding up lookups in `HashMap` and `HashSet`. |
| **Reliability** | Ensures stability in APIs, database queries, and network paths. |

### **Final Takeaway**
🚀 **Strings are immutable to enhance security, efficiency, and performance.**  
🚀 **Use `StringBuilder` when you need mutable strings.**  

Would you like an example of when to use `StringBuilder` instead of `String`? 😊

# **How does Java handle memory leaks despite having garbage collection?**
### **How Does Java Handle Memory Leaks Despite Having Garbage Collection?**  

Even though Java has an **automatic Garbage Collector (GC)**, **memory leaks** can still occur. Java minimizes memory leaks using **garbage collection mechanisms**, but developers must write code carefully to avoid unintentional memory retention.

---

## **1. What is a Memory Leak in Java?**  
A **memory leak** occurs when objects are **no longer needed** but **are still referenced**, preventing GC from reclaiming their memory.

💡 **Garbage Collection only removes objects that are unreachable.** If an object **remains reachable but is never used again**, it **stays in memory**, leading to a **memory leak**.

---

## **2. How Java Prevents Memory Leaks Using Garbage Collection**
### ✅ **Automatic Garbage Collection (GC)**
Java uses **GC algorithms** (like Mark-and-Sweep, Generational GC) to automatically free up memory.

#### **How GC Works?**
1. **Marks** objects that are still referenced.
2. **Sweeps** (removes) objects that are unreachable.
3. **Compacts** memory to avoid fragmentation.

---

## **3. How Memory Leaks Still Occur in Java?**
Even with **Garbage Collection**, memory leaks happen when objects are **unintentionally held in memory**. Here are the **common causes**:

### **🔴 1. Static Collections Holding References (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`)**
- Objects stored in **static collections** remain in memory **for the lifetime of the application**.

#### **Example: Memory Leak with a Static List**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class MemoryLeakExample {
    private static final List<String> cache = new ArrayList<>();

    public static void addToCache(String data) {
        cache.add(data); // Objects remain in memory indefinitely
    }
}
```
✅ **Fix:** Remove objects when they are no longer needed:
```java
cache.clear();
```
OR use **WeakHashMap** (which allows GC to remove unused keys).

---

### **🔴 2. Unclosed Resources (File Streams, Database Connections)**
If **resources like files or database connections are not closed**, they stay in memory.

#### **Example: Memory Leak with Unclosed Stream**
```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileLeak {
    public static void readFile() throws IOException {
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("data.txt");
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fis));
        // Forgot to close the stream, causing a leak!
    }
}
```
✅ **Fix:** Use **try-with-resources** to automatically close resources:
```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data.txt"))) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
}
```

---

### **🔴 3. Inner Classes Holding Outer Class References**
If a **non-static inner class** holds a reference to an **outer class**, it prevents the outer class from being garbage collected.

#### **Example: Memory Leak in Inner Class**
```java
class Outer {
    class Inner {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Inner class");
        }
    }
}
```
✅ **Fix:** Use **static nested classes**:
```java
class Outer {
    static class Inner {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Static inner class");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **🔴 4. Registering Unused Listeners in GUI Applications**
If event listeners are not unregistered, they **keep objects in memory**, even after they are no longer needed.

#### **Example: Memory Leak with Event Listeners**
```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

class MemoryLeakGUI {
    private Frame frame;

    public void createGUI() {
        frame = new Frame("Memory Leak");
        frame.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
                System.out.println("Closing");
            }
        });
    }
}
```
✅ **Fix:** Remove listeners when no longer needed:
```java
frame.removeWindowListener(windowListener);
```

---

### **🔴 5. ThreadLocal Objects Holding References**
A **`ThreadLocal`** object can **retain references** even after a thread completes execution.

#### **Example: Memory Leak with ThreadLocal**
```java
class ThreadLocalLeak {
    private static final ThreadLocal<String> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static void setValue(String value) {
        threadLocal.set(value);
    }
}
```
✅ **Fix:** Call `remove()` explicitly:
```java
threadLocal.remove();
```

---

## **4. How to Detect and Fix Memory Leaks?**
### ✅ **Using Java Profilers**
Use tools like:
- **VisualVM**
- **JProfiler**
- **Eclipse MAT (Memory Analyzer Tool)**

### ✅ **Enable GC Logs for Analysis**
Run your application with:
```
-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps
```
### ✅ **Use Weak References**
Use **`WeakReference`** or **`WeakHashMap`** to allow GC to collect unused objects.

---

## **5. Summary**
| **Cause of Memory Leak** | **Fix** |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **Static collections (e.g., List, Map) hold references** | Use `WeakHashMap`, clear lists when done |
| **Unclosed resources (files, DB connections)** | Use `try-with-resources` |
| **Inner classes holding outer class references** | Use **static inner classes** |
| **Event listeners not unregistered** | Remove listeners when no longer needed |
| **ThreadLocal variables not cleared** | Call `ThreadLocal.remove()` |

---

## **Final Takeaway**
🚀 **Java's Garbage Collector helps, but memory leaks still happen if references are not handled properly.**  
✅ Follow **best practices** like closing resources, using weak references, and profiling memory usage.

# **What happens if a finally block contains a return statement? Does it override the try block’s return value?**
### **What Happens If a `finally` Block Contains a `return` Statement?**
If a `finally` block contains a `return` statement, **it will override any return value from the `try` or `catch` block**. This is because the `finally` block **always executes**, and if it has a `return`, it will forcefully return from the method, disregarding any previous return values.

---

## **1. Example: `finally` Overriding `try` Return Value**
```java
public class FinallyReturnExample {
    public static int testMethod() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            return 10;
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");
            return 20; // Overrides the return value from try
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Returned Value: " + testMethod());
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Inside try block
Inside finally block
Returned Value: 20
```
🔹 **Even though `try` returns `10`, the `finally` block overrides it and returns `20`.**

---

## **2. What Happens If an Exception is Thrown?**
If an exception occurs in the `try` block and the `finally` block has a `return`, the exception **is suppressed**, and the `finally` return value is used instead.

### **Example: Exception in Try, Return in Finally**
```java
public class FinallyReturnExample {
    public static int testMethod() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            int x = 5 / 0; // Throws ArithmeticException
            return 10;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside catch block");
            return 15;
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");
            return 20; // Overrides catch block's return
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Returned Value: " + testMethod());
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Inside try block
Inside catch block
Inside finally block
Returned Value: 20
```
🔹 **The exception is caught, and `catch` tries to return `15`, but `finally` overrides it and returns `20`.**

---

## **3. What If `finally` Doesn't Have a Return Statement?**
If `finally` does **not** contain a return statement, the return value from `try` or `catch` will be used.

### **Example: Finally Without Return**
```java
public class FinallyReturnExample {
    public static int testMethod() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            return 10;
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Returned Value: " + testMethod());
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Inside try block
Inside finally block
Returned Value: 10
```
🔹 **Since `finally` doesn't return anything, the return value from `try` (`10`) is used.**

---

## **4. Why Should You Avoid `return` in `finally`?**
Using `return` inside `finally` is **not recommended** because:
1. **It makes debugging difficult** – Overrides try/catch return values, causing unexpected behavior.
2. **It suppresses exceptions** – If an exception occurs, it gets discarded.
3. **It leads to unpredictable results** – Return values can be unintentionally changed.

🔴 **Example: Suppressing an Exception**
```java
public class FinallyReturnExample {
    public static int testMethod() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            int x = 5 / 0; // Exception occurs
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");
            return 100; // Suppresses the ArithmeticException
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Returned Value: " + testMethod());
    }
}
```
### **Output (No Exception Thrown!):**
```
Inside try block
Inside finally block
Returned Value: 100
```
🔹 **The ArithmeticException is suppressed, which is dangerous!**

---

## **5. Best Practices**
### ✅ **Avoid returning from `finally`**  
Instead, let `try` or `catch` return the value.
```java
public class FinallyBestPractice {
    public static int testMethod() {
        int result = 0;
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            result = 10;
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");
        }
        return result; // Proper way to return
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Returned Value: " + testMethod());
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Inside try block
Inside finally block
Returned Value: 10
```

## **6. Summary**
| **Scenario** | **Behavior** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **`return` in `try` and `finally` both** | `finally` **overrides** `try` return value |
| **Exception in `try`, return in `finally`** | Exception is **suppressed**, `finally` return is used |
| **No return in `finally`** | `try` or `catch` return value is used |
| **Using `return` in `finally`** | ❌ **Bad practice! Avoid it!** |

### **Final Takeaway**
🚀 **Never use `return` inside `finally`. It overrides values and suppresses exceptions.**  
✅ **Instead, let `try` or `catch` handle the return.**

# **Can a try block exist without a catch block in Java?**
Yes, a `try` block can exist without a `catch` block in Java, but it must be followed by a `finally` block.  

### **Explanation:**  
In Java, the `try` block is used to enclose code that may throw an exception. While a `catch` block is typically used to handle exceptions, Java also allows a `try` block to be used with a `finally` block, even if no `catch` block is present.

### **Syntax:**
```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} finally {
    // Code that will always execute, regardless of an exception
}
```

### **Example:**
```java
public class TryWithoutCatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            int result = 10 / 2;  // No exception occurs
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block executed");
        }
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Inside try block
Finally block executed
```

### **Key Points:**
- A `try` block **must be followed** by at least one `catch` or `finally` block.
- The `finally` block **always executes**, even if an exception occurs or if a `return` statement is present inside the `try` block.
- If an exception occurs inside the `try` block and there is no `catch` block, the program will terminate after executing the `finally` block.

# **What happens if a catch block throws an exception?**
If a `catch` block throws an exception, the new exception will propagate up the call stack, potentially terminating the program if it is not handled.  

### **Explanation:**  
When an exception occurs in the `try` block, the corresponding `catch` block executes. If the `catch` block itself throws an exception and there is no outer `try-catch` structure to handle it, the program will terminate abnormally.

### **Example:**  
```java
public class CatchBlockException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0; // This will cause ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
            throw new NullPointerException("New exception in catch block"); // Throws new exception
        }
        System.out.println("This line will not be executed");
    }
}
```

### **Output:**
```
Exception caught: / by zero
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: New exception in catch block
    at CatchBlockException.main(CatchBlockException.java:8)
```

### **Key Points:**
1. The original exception (`ArithmeticException`) is caught, but the new exception (`NullPointerException`) thrown in the `catch` block propagates further.
2. If no outer `try-catch` handles this new exception, the program will terminate abnormally.
3. If the `catch` block throws an exception and a `finally` block is present, the `finally` block will execute before the program crashes.

### **Handling the Exception Properly:**  
To prevent unexpected crashes, handle exceptions properly by nesting `try-catch` blocks:
```java
public class HandleCatchException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            try {
                System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
                throw new NullPointerException("New exception in catch block");
            } catch (NullPointerException ex) {
                System.out.println("Handled new exception: " + ex.getMessage());
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues normally");
    }
}
```

### **Output:**
```
Exception caught: / by zero
Handled new exception: New exception in catch block
Program continues normally
```

# **Can we throw an exception inside a finally block? What happens in such a case?**
### **Can We Throw an Exception Inside a `finally` Block?**  
Yes, we **can** throw an exception inside a `finally` block in Java. However, doing so has specific consequences:

### **What Happens If an Exception is Thrown in a `finally` Block?**  
1. **The `finally` block always executes**, regardless of whether an exception was thrown in the `try` or `catch` block.  
2. If an exception is thrown inside the `finally` block:
   - It **overrides any exception thrown in the `try` or `catch` block**, meaning the original exception may be lost.  
   - If not handled, it will propagate up the call stack, potentially crashing the program.  
   - If both the `try` block and `finally` block throw exceptions, **only the exception from the `finally` block is retained**.

---

### **Example: Exception in `finally` Block Overriding Original Exception**
```java
public class FinallyExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            throw new ArithmeticException("Exception from try block");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");
            throw new NullPointerException("Exception from finally block"); // Overrides try block exception
        }
    }
}
```

### **Output:**
```
Inside try block
Caught: Exception from try block
Inside finally block
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Exception from finally block
    at FinallyExceptionExample.main(FinallyExceptionExample.java:12)
```

#### **Explanation:**
- The `try` block throws an `ArithmeticException`, which is caught.
- The `finally` block executes and throws a `NullPointerException`.
- The `NullPointerException` **overrides** the `ArithmeticException`, and only `NullPointerException` is propagated.

---

### **Example: Handling Exception in `finally` Block to Prevent Program Crash**
To avoid losing the original exception, we can handle the exception inside the `finally` block:
```java
public class FinallyExceptionHandled {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            throw new ArithmeticException("Exception from try block");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                System.out.println("Inside finally block");
                throw new NullPointerException("Exception from finally block");
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                System.out.println("Handled exception in finally: " + ex.getMessage());
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues normally");
    }
}
```

### **Output:**
```
Inside try block
Caught: Exception from try block
Inside finally block
Handled exception in finally: Exception from finally block
Program continues normally
```

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
✅ Yes, you **can** throw an exception inside a `finally` block.  
❌ If not handled, it **overrides any previous exceptions** and propagates up the call stack.  
✅ It is a **best practice to handle exceptions inside the `finally` block** to avoid losing original exceptions.

# **What is the difference between throw and throws in Java?**
### **Difference Between `throw` and `throws` in Java**  

Both `throw` and `throws` are used in Java for handling exceptions, but they have different purposes and usages.  

| Feature       | `throw` | `throws` |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Definition** | Used to explicitly throw an exception. | Declares exceptions that a method might throw. |
| **Usage** | Inside a method or block of code. | In the method signature. |
| **Keyword Placement** | Used within a method. | Used in the method declaration. |
| **Exception Type** | Can throw a single instance of an exception. | Can declare multiple exceptions separated by commas. |
| **Example Usage** | `throw new ArithmeticException("Divide by zero");` | `public void myMethod() throws IOException, SQLException` |
| **Handling Requirement** | The thrown exception must be handled using `try-catch` or declared in `throws`. | The method that calls this method must handle or propagate the exception. |

---

### **1️⃣ `throw` Example (Used to Explicitly Throw an Exception)**
```java
public class ThrowExample {
    public static void validateAge(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or above");
        }
        System.out.println("You are eligible!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        validateAge(16);  // This will throw an exception
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Age must be 18 or above
```
🚀 **Explanation:** `throw` is used to explicitly throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

---

### **2️⃣ `throws` Example (Declares Exceptions in Method Signature)**
```java
import java.io.*;

public class ThrowsExample {
    public static void readFile() throws IOException {
        FileReader file = new FileReader("test.txt"); // May cause IOException
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(file);
        System.out.println(br.readLine());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            readFile();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception handled: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
**Output (if file does not exist):**
```
Exception handled: test.txt (No such file or directory)
```
🚀 **Explanation:** The `readFile()` method declares `throws IOException`, so the caller (i.e., `main`) must handle it using `try-catch`.

---

### **Key Differences Simplified:**
| **Feature** | **throw** | **throws** |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Used for **throwing** an exception. | Used for **declaring** exceptions in a method. |
| Used **inside a method**. | Used **with method signature**. |
| Throws a **single** exception at a time. | Can declare **multiple** exceptions. |
| Must be followed by an **exception object**. | Must be followed by **exception class names**. |

---

### **When to Use What?**
✅ Use `throw` when you want to **manually trigger an exception** inside a method.  
✅ Use `throws` when you **want to indicate that a method may throw an exception**, forcing the caller to handle it.

# **What happens if an exception occurs inside a static block? Will the class load?**
### **What Happens If an Exception Occurs Inside a Static Block?**  

A **static block** in Java is executed when the class is loaded into memory. If an exception occurs inside a static block, the class **fails to load**, and a `ExceptionInInitializerError` is thrown.  

---

### **Behavior of Static Block with Exception**  

1️⃣ If an **unchecked exception (RuntimeException or Error)** occurs, the class will **not be loaded**, and `ExceptionInInitializerError` will be thrown.  
2️⃣ If a **checked exception** occurs, it must be handled inside the static block, or the class **won't load**.  

---

### **Example: Unchecked Exception in Static Block**
```java
public class StaticBlockTest {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block executing...");
        int result = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method executing...");
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Static block executing...
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
Caused by: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
```
🚀 **Explanation:** The division by zero (`10 / 0`) causes an `ArithmeticException`, which is wrapped inside `ExceptionInInitializerError`. The class **does not load**, and `main()` never executes.

---

### **Example: Checked Exception in Static Block**
```java
public class StaticBlockCheckedException {
    static {
        try {
            throw new Exception("Checked Exception in static block");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception handled: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main method executing...");
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Exception handled: Checked Exception in static block
Main method executing...
```
🚀 **Explanation:** Since the **checked exception is handled**, the class loads successfully, and `main()` executes.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- If an **unchecked exception** occurs in a static block, the **class fails to load** (`ExceptionInInitializerError`).
- If a **checked exception** occurs, it **must be handled** inside the static block for the class to load.
- If the class fails to load, no objects of the class can be created, and `main()` (if present) **will not execute**.

# **Why is main() declared as public static void main(String[] args)? Can we overload main()?**
### **Why is `main()` Declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`?**  

In Java, the `main()` method serves as the entry point for program execution. It is defined as:  

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
Each keyword in this declaration has a specific purpose:

1. **`public`** → The method must be public so that the JVM can access it from outside the class.  
2. **`static`** → Since `main()` is the entry point, it must be called **without creating an object** of the class.  
3. **`void`** → `main()` does not return any value to the JVM, so the return type is `void`.  
4. **`main`** → This is the method name recognized by the JVM as the program's starting point.  
5. **`String[] args`** → This is used to accept **command-line arguments** when running the program.  

---

### **Can We Overload `main()`?**  

Yes! Java **allows method overloading**, so we can have multiple `main()` methods with different parameter lists.  

#### **Example of Overloaded `main()`**
```java
public class MainOverloading {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Standard main method");
        main(10);
        main("Hello");
    }

    public static void main(int num) {
        System.out.println("Overloaded main with int: " + num);
    }

    public static void main(String message) {
        System.out.println("Overloaded main with String: " + message);
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Standard main method
Overloaded main with int: 10
Overloaded main with String: Hello
```
🚀 **Explanation:**  
- The JVM **only calls** `public static void main(String[] args)`.  
- The overloaded `main()` methods are called **explicitly** from within `main(String[] args)`.  
- The JVM does **not** invoke overloaded `main()` methods automatically.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✔ `main()` is `public` so the JVM can access it.  
✔ `main()` is `static` so it runs **without creating an object**.  
✔ Overloading `main()` is **possible**, but only `main(String[] args)` is called by the JVM.  
✔ Overloaded `main()` methods must be **invoked explicitly** from within the standard `main()`.

# **Why is volatile not enough to make a field thread-safe?**
### **Why is `volatile` Not Enough to Make a Field Thread-Safe?**  

The `volatile` keyword in Java ensures **visibility** of changes to variables across threads, but it does **not** guarantee atomicity or mutual exclusion. This means `volatile` alone is **not enough** to make a field completely thread-safe in all cases.  

---

### **Limitations of `volatile`**
1. **No Atomicity for Compound Operations**  
   `volatile` ensures that the latest value of a variable is read from main memory, but it **does not** make operations like increment (`count++`) atomic.  

   **Example:**
   ```java
   class Counter {
       private volatile int count = 0;

       public void increment() {
           count++;  // Not atomic: Read, Modify, Write
       }
   }
   ```
   - Multiple threads calling `increment()` **may read stale values** and overwrite each other’s updates.
   - This **leads to race conditions**, making the final count unpredictable.

---

2. **No Mutual Exclusion (Synchronization)**  
   - `volatile` **does not** prevent multiple threads from modifying the variable at the same time.  
   - If two threads update a `volatile` variable **concurrently**, **data corruption** can occur.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   class SharedResource {
       private volatile boolean flag = false;

       public void toggle() {
           if (!flag) {   // Thread 1 checks
               flag = true;  // Thread 2 modifies before Thread 1 executes
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - A race condition can **still occur**, leading to an inconsistent state.

---

3. **Does Not Provide Atomicity for Complex Objects**  
   - If a `volatile` variable refers to an **object**, only the reference is volatile, not the object's internal state.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   class SharedData {
       private volatile Data data = new Data();  // Only reference is volatile

       public void updateData(int newValue) {
           data.setValue(newValue);  // Modification inside object is NOT atomic
       }
   }
   ```
   - Multiple threads can modify `data` **concurrently**, leading to **corrupted** values.

---

### **How to Ensure Thread-Safety?**
To **truly** make a field thread-safe, use:
1. **`synchronized` Methods or Blocks**  
   ```java
   class SafeCounter {
       private int count = 0;

       public synchronized void increment() {
           count++;  // Ensures atomicity
       }
   }
   ```
   - Ensures **mutual exclusion** by allowing only one thread to execute at a time.

2. **`AtomicInteger` (for Counters and Numeric Operations)**  
   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

   class AtomicCounter {
       private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

       public void increment() {
           count.incrementAndGet();  // Atomic operation
       }
   }
   ```
   - Provides **atomic operations** without needing `synchronized`.

3. **`ReentrantLock` for Fine-Grained Locking**  
   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

   class LockBasedCounter {
       private int count = 0;
       private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

       public void increment() {
           lock.lock();
           try {
               count++;
           } finally {
               lock.unlock();
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - More flexible than `synchronized`, allowing fine control over locking.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✔ `volatile` **ensures visibility** but **not atomicity** or **mutual exclusion**.  
✔ **Operations like `count++` are not atomic**, leading to race conditions.  
✔ Use **`synchronized`**, **`AtomicInteger`**, or **locks** for full thread safety.

# **What is the difference between synchronized and Lock in Java concurrency?**
### **Difference Between `synchronized` and `Lock` in Java Concurrency**  

Both `synchronized` and `Lock` are used to achieve thread synchronization in Java, but they differ in flexibility, performance, and usability.  

---

## **1. `synchronized` (Implicit Locking)**
The `synchronized` keyword in Java provides **implicit** locking and is simpler to use.  

**Example:**
```java
class SynchronizedExample {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;  // Automatically locks and unlocks
    }
}
```
### **Characteristics of `synchronized`**
✔ **Implicit Locking:** No need to explicitly acquire/release locks.  
✔ **Automatic Unlocking:** Lock is released automatically when the method/block execution completes.  
✔ **Blocking:** If one thread holds the lock, others **must wait** until it is released.  
✔ **Thread Safety:** Ensures mutual exclusion, preventing race conditions.  
✔ **Cannot Try Locking:** No mechanism to check if the lock is available without blocking.  

---

## **2. `Lock` (Explicit Locking)**
The `Lock` interface (from `java.util.concurrent.locks`) provides **explicit** locking with more control.  

**Example using `ReentrantLock`:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class LockExample {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();  // Must acquire lock explicitly
        try {
            count++;  // Critical section
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();  // Must release lock explicitly
        }
    }
}
```
### **Characteristics of `Lock`**
✔ **Explicit Locking:** Must explicitly acquire and release the lock.  
✔ **Try-Lock Feature:** Can check if the lock is available without blocking (`tryLock()`).  
✔ **Interruptible Locking:** Supports **interruptible** waiting for locks.  
✔ **Fairness Policy:** Can ensure fair access (`ReentrantLock(true)`).  
✔ **Read-Write Locking:** Supports `ReadWriteLock` for better performance in read-heavy scenarios.  

---

## **3. Key Differences**
| Feature               | `synchronized` | `Lock` (e.g., `ReentrantLock`) |
|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Lock Type           | Implicit      | Explicit (must lock/unlock manually) |
| Lock Release       | Auto (on method/block exit) | Manual (must call `unlock()`) |
| Try-Lock Feature    | No           | Yes (`tryLock()`) |
| Interruptible Lock | No           | Yes (`lockInterruptibly()`) |
| Fairness Control   | No           | Yes (`ReentrantLock(true)`) |
| Performance        | Less flexible | More flexible for high concurrency |
| Read/Write Lock    | No           | Yes (`ReadWriteLock`) |

---

## **4. When to Use What?**
✅ Use **`synchronized`** when:
- Simplicity is preferred (auto-locking/unlocking).  
- Locking only small sections of code.  
- There are no fairness or try-lock requirements.  

✅ Use **`Lock`** when:
- You need **fine-grained control** over locking.  
- You want to **avoid blocking** (`tryLock()`).  
- You need **fairness policies** (`ReentrantLock(true)`).  
- You require **interruptible locks** (`lockInterruptibly()`).  

---

### **Conclusion**
- `synchronized` is **simpler and easier to use** but lacks flexibility.  
- `Lock` provides **more control and features** but requires manual lock handling.  
- In **high-concurrency scenarios**, `Lock` is often preferred for better performance.

# **How can we achieve thread safety without using synchronized?**
### **How Can We Achieve Thread Safety Without Using `synchronized`?**  

Thread safety ensures that shared data is accessed and modified correctly in a multi-threaded environment. While `synchronized` is the most common way to achieve thread safety, we can also use other techniques for better performance and flexibility.  

---

## **1. Using `volatile` (for Visibility, Not Atomicity)**
The `volatile` keyword ensures that updates to a variable are immediately visible to all threads. However, it **does not provide atomicity** for operations involving multiple steps.  

✅ **Best for:** Single variable reads/writes (not for compound actions like incrementing).  

**Example:**  
```java
class VolatileExample {
    private volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void setFlag() {
        flag = true;  // Change is immediately visible to all threads
    }

    public boolean getFlag() {
        return flag;
    }
}
```
🚨 **Limitation:** Not suitable for **increment operations (`count++`)**, as it is not atomic.

---

## **2. Using Atomic Variables (`java.util.concurrent.atomic` Package)**
Atomic classes provide **lock-free** thread safety for variables. These include:  
- `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicBoolean`, `AtomicReference`, etc.  

✅ **Best for:** Atomic operations like incrementing/decrementing counters.  

**Example:**  
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class AtomicExample {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet();  // Atomic operation
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();
    }
}
```
🚀 **Advantage:** Faster than `synchronized` due to hardware-level atomic operations.  

---

## **3. Using `Lock` (Explicit Locking)**
Instead of `synchronized`, we can use `ReentrantLock` for **fine-grained control** over locks.  

✅ **Best for:** When explicit lock handling, fairness, or interruptible locks are needed.  

**Example:**  
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class LockExample {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```
✔ **Supports tryLock() and fairness policies.**  

---

## **4. Using `Concurrent Collections`**
Instead of `synchronized` lists/maps, use **thread-safe collections** from `java.util.concurrent`.  

✅ **Best for:** When multiple threads modify shared collections.  

**Examples:**  
- `ConcurrentHashMap` (instead of `HashMap`).  
- `CopyOnWriteArrayList` (instead of `ArrayList`).  
- `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` (instead of `LinkedList`).  

**Example using `ConcurrentHashMap`:**  
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

class ConcurrentExample {
    private ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void addItem(int key, String value) {
        map.put(key, value);
    }

    public String getItem(int key) {
        return map.get(key);
    }
}
```
✔ **Better scalability than `Collections.synchronizedMap()`**  

---

## **5. Using `ThreadLocal` (Thread-Scoped Variables)**
Each thread gets its **own independent copy** of a variable, avoiding synchronization.  

✅ **Best for:** Per-thread data (e.g., user sessions, database connections).  

**Example:**  
```java
class ThreadLocalExample {
    private static ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalValue = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);

    public void set(int value) {
        threadLocalValue.set(value);
    }

    public int get() {
        return threadLocalValue.get();
    }
}
```
✔ **Prevents shared data access altogether!**  

---

## **6. Using Immutable Objects (Final + No Setters)**
Immutable objects **cannot be modified after creation**, ensuring thread safety **by design**.  

✅ **Best for:** Shared read-only data.  

**Example:**  
```java
final class ImmutableExample {
    private final String name;

    public ImmutableExample(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```
✔ **Safe even when accessed by multiple threads!**  

---

## **7. Using ForkJoinPool (Parallel Processing)**
For heavy parallel computations, `ForkJoinPool` uses **work-stealing** for better efficiency.  

✅ **Best for:** Recursive tasks (e.g., parallel sorting, large data processing).  

**Example using `RecursiveTask`:**  
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    private int start, end;

    public SumTask(int start, int end) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (end - start <= 10) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) sum += i;
            return sum;
        }
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        SumTask leftTask = new SumTask(start, mid);
        SumTask rightTask = new SumTask(mid + 1, end);
        leftTask.fork();
        return rightTask.compute() + leftTask.join();
    }
}

public class ForkJoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        int result = pool.invoke(new SumTask(1, 100));
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}
```
✔ **Efficient for large computations!**  

---

## **Summary: Best Approach for Each Scenario**
| Approach | When to Use? |
|----------|-------------|
| `volatile` | Ensuring visibility of simple variables (not atomic operations). |
| `Atomic Variables` | Lock-free atomic operations (e.g., counters). |
| `Lock` (`ReentrantLock`) | When explicit locking/unlocking control is required. |
| `Concurrent Collections` | For thread-safe lists, maps, and queues. |
| `ThreadLocal` | When each thread needs its own isolated variable. |
| `Immutable Objects` | When data should not be modified after creation. |
| `ForkJoinPool` | For parallel computations and recursive tasks. |

---

### **Conclusion**
- `synchronized` is simple but can cause performance bottlenecks.  
- Alternative approaches like **atomic variables, concurrent collections, locks, and immutability** can improve performance and scalability.  
- The best choice depends on the specific **use case and concurrency level** required.

# **What are the possible issues with using double-checked locking in Java?**
### **Possible Issues with Using Double-Checked Locking in Java**  

**Double-checked locking** is a common optimization pattern used to **lazily initialize** a singleton instance while ensuring thread safety. However, it comes with potential pitfalls if not implemented correctly.

---

## **1. Race Condition Due to Reordering (Before Java 5)**
Before Java 5, the JVM **could reorder instructions** due to compiler optimizations and CPU caching. This could cause another thread to see a **partially initialized** object.

### **Example of Incorrect Double-Checked Locking (Pre-Java 5)**
```java
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}  // Private constructor

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {  // First check (without locking)
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {  // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new Singleton();  // Issue: Object may not be fully initialized
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
**Problem:**  
- Due to **instruction reordering**, the `instance` reference might be assigned **before the constructor completes execution**.
- A second thread may access an **incomplete instance**.

✅ **Solution:** Use `volatile` (introduced in Java 5) to prevent instruction reordering.

---

## **2. Performance Overhead**
Even though double-checked locking **reduces the need for synchronization**, **some locking still happens** when the instance is first created.

- **In multi-threaded environments**, performance may be impacted if many threads attempt to initialize the singleton at the same time.
- `synchronized` is still **expensive** compared to alternatives like `enum`-based singletons.

✅ **Solution:** Use an **eager initialization** or `static` block if performance is a concern.

---

## **3. Complexity & Readability**
- The pattern **adds unnecessary complexity** compared to simpler approaches.
- Code maintenance is harder, as incorrect implementations can lead to subtle **concurrency bugs**.

✅ **Solution:** Prefer simpler alternatives like **Bill Pugh Singleton** or `enum`-based singletons.

---

## **4. Alternative: Correct Implementation with `volatile`**
Using `volatile` ensures **visibility and prevents instruction reordering**.

✅ **Corrected Double-Checked Locking:**
```java
class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;  // Volatile prevents reordering

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {  // First check (without locking)
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {  // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new Singleton();  // Safe initialization
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
✔ **Works correctly in Java 5+**  
✔ **Ensures full initialization before reference assignment**  

---

## **5. Alternative: Bill Pugh Singleton (Recommended)**
A better alternative is the **Bill Pugh Singleton pattern**, which **relies on JVM class loading** instead of double-checked locking.

✅ **Recommended Singleton Implementation:**
```java
class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {}

    private static class Holder {
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return Holder.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```
✔ **No synchronization overhead**  
✔ **Lazy-loaded & thread-safe**  
✔ **Simple & easy to maintain**  

---

### **Summary of Issues with Double-Checked Locking**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Instruction reordering (pre-Java 5)** | Use `volatile` |
| **Performance overhead** | Use alternative patterns like Bill Pugh or Enum |
| **Code complexity** | Prefer simpler implementations |
| **Possible broken singleton instance** | Ensure correct volatile use |

---

### **Conclusion**
Double-checked locking **can be safe if implemented correctly** (with `volatile`), but it is still **not the best approach** for singletons. **Bill Pugh Singleton** or **`enum`-based singletons** are often **better, safer, and cleaner alternatives**.

# **How does the HashMap internal implementation handle collisions?**
### **How Does HashMap Handle Collisions Internally in Java?**  

A **HashMap** in Java uses a **hashing mechanism** to store key-value pairs efficiently. However, since multiple keys may generate the **same hash code**, a mechanism is needed to handle **collisions** effectively.

---

## **1. What Causes Collisions?**  
Collisions occur when two different keys **map to the same bucket** due to:  
- **Hash function limitations**  
- **Limited number of buckets (capacity)**  
- **Different keys producing the same `hashCode()`**  

Example:  
```java
int index1 = "AB".hashCode() % 16;  // Suppose index1 = 3
int index2 = "BA".hashCode() % 16;  // Suppose index2 = 3  (collision)
```
Here, `"AB"` and `"BA"` hash to the **same bucket**, causing a **collision**.

---

## **2. Collision Handling Mechanisms in HashMap**
Java’s `HashMap` handles collisions using **two main approaches**:

### **A. Before Java 8: Linked List-based Chaining**
- Each bucket is a **linked list**.
- If multiple keys map to the **same index**, they are stored in a **linked list**.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` in the worst case (if all elements fall into one bucket).  

🔹 **Example Implementation (Before Java 8)**  
```java
class Node<K, V> {
    K key;
    V value;
    Node<K, V> next;  // Points to the next node in case of collision
}
```
- **When a collision occurs**, new entries are **appended** to the linked list.
- **Searching for a key** requires **traversing** the linked list.

---

### **B. After Java 8: Tree-Based Collision Handling (Red-Black Tree)**
- If the number of **colliding elements** in a bucket exceeds a threshold (`TREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 8`),  
  **the linked list is converted into a Red-Black Tree**.
- **Why?** Searching in a linked list is `O(n)`, whereas in a **Red-Black Tree**, it is `O(log n)`.
- **Thresholds:**
  - If a bucket has **≥ 8 nodes**, it **converts to a Red-Black Tree**.
  - If elements in a tree **drop below 6**, it **converts back to a linked list**.

🔹 **Example Implementation (After Java 8)**
```java
static final int TREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 8;  // Convert linked list to tree if bucket size >= 8
static final int UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 6; // Convert tree back to linked list if size < 6
```
---

## **3. Steps in Handling Collisions**
### **Step 1: Compute the Bucket Index**
```java
int bucketIndex = hash(key) % capacity;
```
- Java optimizes this using bitwise operations:
```java
int bucketIndex = (key.hashCode() & (capacity - 1));
```

### **Step 2: Check if the Bucket is Empty**
- If **empty**, insert a new node.
- If **not empty**, handle **collision**.

### **Step 3: Collision Handling**
1. **Use a Linked List** (Java 7 & before).  
2. **Convert to a Red-Black Tree** if too many elements exist in a bucket (Java 8+).  

---

## **4. Example of Collision Handling in Java 8**
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapCollisionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            map.put(i % 5, "Value" + i);  // Causes collision on keys 0,1,2,3,4 repeatedly
        }
        System.out.println(map);
    }
}
```
🔹 **Before Java 8:** Linked List (O(n))  
🔹 **After Java 8:** Converts to Red-Black Tree when size ≥ 8 (O(log n))  

---

## **5. Summary Table**
| **Feature**            | **Before Java 8** | **After Java 8 (Java 8+)** |
|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Collision Handling** | Linked List      | Linked List + Red-Black Tree |
| **Lookup Complexity** | `O(n)` in worst case | `O(log n)` when treeified |
| **Threshold for Treeification** | Not applicable | ≥ 8 elements in a bucket |
| **Threshold for Untreeification** | Not applicable | ≤ 6 elements in a bucket |
| **Performance Improvement** | None | Reduces worst-case lookup time |

---

### **6. Conclusion**
- **HashMap handles collisions using linked lists and Red-Black Trees (Java 8+).**
- **Treeification** improves lookup performance in cases of high collisions.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Override `hashCode()` and `equals()` correctly to avoid unintended collisions.
  - Choose an optimal **initial capacity** to reduce collisions.

# **Why should hashCode() and equals() be overridden together?**
### **Why Should `hashCode()` and `equals()` be Overridden Together?**  

In Java, when working with **hash-based collections** (e.g., `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `HashTable`), it is essential to **override both `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods together**. Failing to do so can result in **unexpected behavior**, such as duplicate entries in sets or incorrect key-value retrieval in maps.

---

## **1. Understanding `hashCode()` and `equals()`**
- **`hashCode()`**: Generates an integer (hash code) that determines the bucket index in **hash-based collections**.
- **`equals()`**: Checks if two objects are **logically equal**.

### **Default Behavior (Inherited from `Object`)**
- **`hashCode()`**: Returns an integer based on the object's memory address.
- **`equals()`**: Compares object references (`==`), not their actual values.

---

## **2. Contract Between `hashCode()` and `equals()`**
According to Java's **hashCode-equals contract**:

1. **If two objects are equal (`a.equals(b) == true`), they must have the same hash code (`a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()`).**
2. **If two objects have the same hash code, they may or may not be equal.** (Collisions are possible.)
3. **If `equals()` is overridden, `hashCode()` must also be overridden to maintain consistency.**  

🔹 **Example of a Broken Contract**
```java
class Employee {
    String name;

    Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) { 
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Employee emp = (Employee) obj;
        return this.name.equals(emp.name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("John");
        Employee e2 = new Employee("John");

        HashSet<Employee> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add(e1);
        set.add(e2);

        System.out.println(set.size());  // Output: 2 (Expected: 1)
    }
}
```
💡 **Problem:**  
- `equals()` is overridden but `hashCode()` is not.
- `HashSet` considers `e1` and `e2` as **different objects** because they have **different hash codes**.

---

## **3. Correct Way: Override Both `hashCode()` and `equals()`**
```java
import java.util.Objects;

class Employee {
    String name;

    Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Employee emp = (Employee) obj;
        return this.name.equals(emp.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee e1 = new Employee("John");
        Employee e2 = new Employee("John");

        HashSet<Employee> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add(e1);
        set.add(e2);

        System.out.println(set.size());  // Output: 1 (Correct)
    }
}
```
🔹 **Fix:**  
- Overriding `hashCode()` ensures that `e1` and `e2` have the **same hash code**, allowing `HashSet` to recognize them as duplicates.

---

## **4. Why is This Important?**
| **Scenario** | **If Only `equals()` is Overridden** | **If Only `hashCode()` is Overridden** |
|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **HashSet behavior** | May store duplicates | May not detect equality properly |
| **HashMap key retrieval** | May not find values correctly | May allow duplicate keys |
| **Performance impact** | Causes extra lookup time | Inconsistent behavior |

### **Key Takeaways**
✔ **Always override both `hashCode()` and `equals()` together** to maintain correctness.  
✔ **Ensure that logically equal objects have the same hash code** to avoid unexpected behavior in collections.

# **What is the difference between ConcurrentHashMap and Collections.synchronizedMap()?**
### **Difference Between `ConcurrentHashMap` and `Collections.synchronizedMap()` in Java**

Both `ConcurrentHashMap` and `Collections.synchronizedMap()` provide thread-safe alternatives to `HashMap`, but they have significant differences in terms of synchronization, performance, and concurrency handling.

---

## **1. Overview of `ConcurrentHashMap`**
- Introduced in **Java 1.5**, part of the **java.util.concurrent** package.
- Uses **segment-based locking** (before Java 8) and **fine-grained synchronization** (after Java 8) for better concurrency.
- **Multiple threads can read and write simultaneously** without blocking each other.
- **Does not allow `null` keys or values**.

### **Example Usage**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        map.put(1, "Apple");
        map.put(2, "Banana");
        
        System.out.println(map.get(1)); // Output: Apple
    }
}
```
✔ **Better performance for multi-threaded access.**  
✔ **Lock-free read operations** (no blocking).  

---

## **2. Overview of `Collections.synchronizedMap()`**
- A **wrapper** around a normal `HashMap`, making it **fully synchronized**.
- Uses **synchronized methods** to control access, causing performance overhead.
- **Only one thread can access the map at a time** (even for read operations).
- **Allows `null` keys and values** (unlike `ConcurrentHashMap`).

### **Example Usage**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class SynchronizedMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, String> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());
        syncMap.put(1, "Apple");
        syncMap.put(2, "Banana");
        
        System.out.println(syncMap.get(1)); // Output: Apple
    }
}
```
✔ **Simpler to use, suitable for small-scale applications.**  
❌ **Read operations require synchronization, reducing performance in multi-threaded environments.**  

---

## **3. Key Differences**
| Feature               | `ConcurrentHashMap` | `Collections.synchronizedMap()` |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Thread Safety** | Yes, using internal fine-grained locks | Yes, but uses synchronized methods (blocking) |
| **Performance** | High (multiple threads can operate simultaneously) | Low (one thread at a time) |
| **Null Keys/Values** | ❌ Not allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| **Read Operations** | Non-blocking | Requires synchronization (blocking) |
| **Write Operations** | Partial locking (segments before Java 8, bucket-level locking after Java 8) | Entire map is locked during writes |
| **Iteration** | Fail-safe (does not throw `ConcurrentModificationException`) | Fail-fast (throws `ConcurrentModificationException`) |
| **Best Used For** | High-concurrency environments | Low-concurrency or single-threaded environments |

---

## **4. When to Use Which?**
- **Use `ConcurrentHashMap` when**:
  - You need high performance in a **multi-threaded** environment.
  - Your application has frequent **reads and writes**.
  - `null` keys/values are **not required**.

- **Use `Collections.synchronizedMap()` when**:
  - You have **low concurrency** (few threads accessing the map).
  - You need a **quick synchronization wrapper** for an existing `HashMap`.
  - You require **null keys/values**.

---

### **5. Important Notes**
1. **Iteration in `ConcurrentHashMap` is fail-safe** (does not throw `ConcurrentModificationException`).
2. **Iteration in `Collections.synchronizedMap()` is fail-fast** (throws `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified during iteration).
3. **For iteration in `Collections.synchronizedMap()`, external synchronization is required**:
   ```java
   synchronized(syncMap) {
       for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> entry : syncMap.entrySet()) {
           System.out.println(entry.getKey() + " = " + entry.getValue());
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **Conclusion**
- **For multi-threaded environments →** ✅ `ConcurrentHashMap` is the better choice.
- **For single-threaded or low-concurrency use cases →** ✅ `Collections.synchronizedMap()` is sufficient.

# **What is the difference between CopyOnWriteArrayList and synchronizedList()?**
### **Difference Between `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `Collections.synchronizedList()` in Java**

Both `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `Collections.synchronizedList()` provide thread-safe alternatives to `ArrayList`, but they differ in how they handle synchronization, performance, and concurrency.

---

## **1. Overview of `CopyOnWriteArrayList`**
- Introduced in **Java 1.5**, part of the **java.util.concurrent** package.
- Uses a **copy-on-write mechanism**, meaning any modification (`add`, `set`, `remove`, etc.) creates a new copy of the list.
- **Reads are non-blocking**, making it **fast for read-heavy operations**.
- **Writes (modifications) are expensive** due to the creation of a new list copy.
- **Iterators are fail-safe** (won’t throw `ConcurrentModificationException`).

### **Example Usage**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

public class CopyOnWriteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");

        for (String item : list) {
            System.out.println(item);
            list.add("Cherry"); // Allowed, as a new copy is created
        }
        System.out.println("Final List: " + list);
    }
}
```
✔ **Best for read-heavy operations**  
✔ **Iterators don’t throw `ConcurrentModificationException`**  
❌ **Expensive write operations (new list copy on modification)**  

---

## **2. Overview of `Collections.synchronizedList()`**
- A **wrapper around an existing `ArrayList`**, making it **synchronized**.
- Uses **synchronized methods**, meaning all operations (`add`, `get`, `remove`) are **thread-safe but blocking**.
- **Reading and writing operations require synchronization**, reducing performance in multi-threaded environments.
- **Iterators are fail-fast** (throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified during iteration).
- **Explicit synchronization required during iteration**.

### **Example Usage**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class SynchronizedListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");

        synchronized (list) { // Required for safe iteration
            for (String item : list) {
                System.out.println(item);
                list.add("Cherry"); // Throws ConcurrentModificationException
            }
        }
    }
}
```
✔ **Simple synchronization mechanism**  
❌ **Blocking reads and writes**  
❌ **Explicit synchronization needed for iteration**  

---

## **3. Key Differences**
| Feature | `CopyOnWriteArrayList` | `Collections.synchronizedList()` |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Thread Safety** | ✅ Yes (non-blocking reads) | ✅ Yes (blocking reads/writes) |
| **Performance** | ✔ Fast reads, ❌ Slow writes | ❌ Slower reads, ❌ Writes block other operations |
| **Synchronization Mechanism** | Copy-on-write strategy (new copy on modification) | Synchronized methods (blocking) |
| **Iterator Behavior** | ✅ Fail-safe (no `ConcurrentModificationException`) | ❌ Fail-fast (throws `ConcurrentModificationException`) |
| **Use Case** | **Read-heavy** applications | **Balanced read/write** applications |
| **Modification Overhead** | **High** (new copy created on modification) | **Low** (direct modifications on the same list) |

---

## **4. When to Use Which?**
- **Use `CopyOnWriteArrayList` when**:
  - The application is **read-heavy** and **modifications are rare**.
  - You need **fast iteration without synchronization overhead**.
  - The list is frequently used by multiple threads for **read operations**.

- **Use `Collections.synchronizedList()` when**:
  - The application has **frequent modifications (writes and updates)**.
  - You want a simple thread-safe wrapper for an existing `ArrayList`.
  - You are okay with **explicit synchronization during iteration**.

## **5. Important Notes**
1. **Iteration in `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is safe** (it works on a separate copy, so it doesn’t throw `ConcurrentModificationException`).
2. **Iteration in `Collections.synchronizedList()` is not safe** (requires explicit `synchronized` block to avoid `ConcurrentModificationException`).
3. **`CopyOnWriteArrayList` is inefficient for large lists with frequent modifications**, as it **copies the entire list** on each update.
4. **Both do not allow `null` values**, unlike `ArrayList`.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **For read-heavy, multi-threaded applications →** ✅ `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is better.
- **For balanced read/write operations →** ✅ `Collections.synchronizedList()` is more efficient.

# **How Does Java Handle Class Loading? Can We Force Garbage Collection of a Class?**

---

## **1. How Does Java Handle Class Loading?**
Java uses a **lazy, hierarchical, and delegation-based class loading mechanism** to dynamically load classes into memory at runtime. The process involves multiple **class loaders** and follows the **parent delegation model**.

### **Steps in Class Loading Process**
1. **Loading:**  
   - The class loader reads the `.class` file and loads its bytecode into memory.
   - The `ClassLoader` generates a `Class` object for the loaded class.

2. **Linking:**  
   - **Verification:** Ensures bytecode correctness and security constraints.
   - **Preparation:** Allocates memory for static variables.
   - **Resolution:** Converts symbolic references into direct references.

3. **Initialization:**  
   - Executes static initializers (`static {}`) and initializes static variables.

---

### **Class Loaders in Java**
Java has a **hierarchical class loading mechanism**, where each class loader delegates loading to its parent before attempting to load a class itself.

| **Class Loader** | **Description** |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Bootstrap ClassLoader** | Loads core Java classes from `rt.jar` (e.g., `java.lang.*`). |
| **Extension ClassLoader** | Loads classes from `jre/lib/ext/`. |
| **Application ClassLoader** | Loads application classes from the classpath (`CLASSPATH`). |
| **Custom ClassLoader** | Developers can create their own class loaders by extending `ClassLoader`. |

### **Example: Custom Class Loader**
```java
class MyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    @Override
    public Class<?> loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        System.out.println("Loading class: " + name);
        return super.loadClass(name);
    }
}

public class TestClassLoader {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        MyClassLoader loader = new MyClassLoader();
        loader.loadClass("java.lang.String");
    }
}
```

---

## **2. Can We Force Garbage Collection of a Class?**
### **Garbage Collection of Classes**
- Java **does not allow explicit unloading of classes** once they are loaded by a class loader.
- A class can be garbage collected **only if its `ClassLoader` instance itself is eligible for GC**.

### **Conditions for Class Unloading**
1. **No active instances of the class exist.**
2. **The class loader that loaded the class is no longer referenced.**
3. **The class is not a system or bootstrap class.**
4. **Garbage collection occurs in the JVM.**

### **Example: Unloading a Class**
```java
public class TestClassUnloading {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        MyClassLoader loader = new MyClassLoader();
        Class<?> clazz = loader.loadClass("com.example.MyClass");

        // Set class loader to null to remove references
        loader = null;
        clazz = null;

        // Suggest garbage collection
        System.gc();
        System.out.println("GC requested");
    }
}
```
🔹 **Note:** `System.gc()` **does not guarantee** class unloading. It’s only a hint to the JVM.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **You cannot explicitly force Java to unload a class.**
- **Only non-root class loaders (custom class loaders) allow class unloading.**
- **If a class is loaded by the Bootstrap or Application class loader, it remains in memory for the JVM’s lifetime.**
- **Explicit unloading is possible in environments like OSGi, which use dynamic module loading.**

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Java uses a hierarchical class-loading mechanism** with delegation.
- **Class unloading happens only if the class loader itself is eligible for GC.**
- **You cannot explicitly force a class to be garbage collected.**
- **Custom class loaders can be used for dynamic class loading and unloading.**

# **What are the pros and cons of using enum as a singleton?**
### **Pros and Cons of Using `enum` as a Singleton in Java**  

Using an `enum` to implement a **singleton pattern** in Java is a recommended approach because it provides built-in protection against reflection, serialization, and multiple instantiation. However, it also has some limitations. Let's examine its pros and cons.  

---

## **✅ Pros of Using `enum` as a Singleton**  

### **1. Thread-Safety by Default**  
- Enums are inherently **thread-safe** because they are loaded once and initialized by the JVM class loader.  
- No need for synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` or `volatile`.  

### **2. Serialization Safety**  
- Unlike regular singletons, enums **do not require special handling** for serialization.  
- The Java runtime ensures that the same instance is used even after deserialization.  
- Example:  
  ```java
  import java.io.*;

  enum Singleton {
      INSTANCE;
      public void showMessage() {
          System.out.println("Hello from Singleton Enum!");
      }
  }

  public class EnumSerializationTest {
      public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
          Singleton instance1 = Singleton.INSTANCE;

          // Serialize
          ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("singleton.ser"));
          out.writeObject(instance1);
          out.close();

          // Deserialize
          ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("singleton.ser"));
          Singleton instance2 = (Singleton) in.readObject();
          in.close();

          // Same instance after deserialization
          System.out.println(instance1 == instance2); // true
      }
  }
  ```

### **3. Protection Against Reflection Attacks**  
- Regular singleton implementations can be **broken** using reflection (`setAccessible(true)`).  
- `enum` singletons **cannot** be instantiated via reflection because `Enum` does not allow invoking constructors manually.  

  ```java
  import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;

  public class ReflectionBreakSingleton {
      public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
          Constructor<Singleton> constructor = Singleton.class.getDeclaredConstructor();
          constructor.setAccessible(true);
          Singleton instance = constructor.newInstance();  // This will throw an exception
      }
  }
  ```
  **Throws:**
  ```
  java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Singleton.<init>()
  ```

### **4. Simple and Concise Code**  
- Using `enum` eliminates the need for explicit synchronization, double-checked locking, or manually handling serialization.  
- Code is **cleaner and more maintainable**.  

### **5. Guaranteed Singleton Property**  
- Enums **cannot** be cloned, unlike normal singleton classes where `clone()` must be overridden.  
- JVM ensures that **only one instance** exists, preventing accidental multiple instantiations.  

---

## **❌ Cons of Using `enum` as a Singleton**  

### **1. Not Flexible for Lazy Initialization**  
- Enums are **eagerly initialized**, meaning the instance is created as soon as the class is loaded.  
- If your singleton is expensive to create and not always needed, this can be inefficient.  
- Regular singleton patterns allow **lazy initialization**, but `enum` does not.  

### **2. Cannot Extend Other Classes**  
- In Java, enums **implicitly extend `java.lang.Enum`**, so they **cannot extend other classes**.  
- This limits scenarios where a singleton needs to extend an abstract class.  
- Example:  
  ```java
  public enum MySingleton extends SomeOtherClass {  // ❌ Compilation Error
      INSTANCE;
  }
  ```

### **3. Not Suitable for Dependency Injection**  
- Enums are not easily **mockable** in unit testing.  
- Regular singleton classes can be instantiated with different configurations using dependency injection frameworks like **Spring**, but enums cannot.  
- Example:  
  ```java
  @Bean
  public MyService myService() {
      return new MyServiceImpl(); // Regular singleton, can be mocked in tests
  }
  ```

### **4. Not Suitable for Singletons That Need Parameters**  
- If your singleton requires parameters during instantiation, `enum` **cannot support it**.  
- Workarounds involve using **instance fields and setters**, which are not ideal.  
- Example:
  ```java
  public enum ConfigManager {
      INSTANCE;  // Cannot pass parameters here

      private String config;

      public void setConfig(String config) {
          this.config = config;
      }

      public String getConfig() {
          return config;
      }
  }
  ```
  - **Problem:** Requires an additional `setConfig()` method, violating immutability.  

---

## **✅ When to Use `enum` Singleton?**
✅ **Use `enum` when:**
- You need **serialization and reflection safety** by default.  
- You want a **simpler and thread-safe** singleton implementation.  
- Your singleton does **not require lazy initialization or parameters**.  

❌ **Avoid `enum` when:**
- You need **lazy initialization**.  
- The singleton must **extend another class**.  
- You need **dependency injection** and mocking for unit tests.  
- Your singleton requires **dynamic parameters** during creation.  

---

### **🚀 Conclusion**
Using `enum` for singletons is a **clean, safe, and efficient** approach when you need a **thread-safe, serialization-proof singleton**. However, if you require **lazy initialization, subclassing, or dependency injection**, a regular singleton implementation might be better.

# **What Happens If Two Threads Try to Initialize a Singleton Instance at the Same Time?**  

In a multithreaded environment, if **two threads attempt to initialize a singleton instance simultaneously**, it can lead to **race conditions** and **multiple instance creation** if not properly handled. The behavior depends on how the singleton is implemented.  

---

## **1. Singleton Without Synchronization (Thread-Unsafe Singleton)**
If a singleton is implemented without synchronization, multiple threads can **create multiple instances** due to race conditions.  

### **Example (Thread-Unsafe Singleton)**
```java
public class UnsafeSingleton {
    private static UnsafeSingleton instance;

    private UnsafeSingleton() {} // Private constructor

    public static UnsafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {  // Thread 1 and Thread 2 can enter here simultaneously
            instance = new UnsafeSingleton();  // Multiple instances can be created
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
### **Problem**
- If **two threads** execute `getInstance()` **at the same time**, both may find `instance == null` and create separate instances.  
- **Breaks the Singleton property** of having a single instance.  

---

## **2. Using Synchronized Method (Thread-Safe, but Slower)**
We can use `synchronized` to prevent multiple threads from accessing `getInstance()` at the same time.  

### **Example (Synchronized Singleton)**
```java
public class SynchronizedSingleton {
    private static SynchronizedSingleton instance;

    private SynchronizedSingleton() {}

    public static synchronized SynchronizedSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SynchronizedSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
### **Drawback**
- The **entire method is synchronized**, causing a **performance bottleneck** if multiple threads frequently call `getInstance()`.  

---

## **3. Double-Checked Locking (Optimized Thread-Safe Singleton)**
The **double-checked locking** technique improves performance by synchronizing only the first-time initialization.  

### **Example (Best Practice)**
```java
public class DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton {
    private static volatile DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton instance;

    private DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton() {}

    public static DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {  // First check (without locking)
            synchronized (DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {  // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new DoubleCheckedLockingSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
### **Why It Works?**
- **First Check:** Avoids synchronization overhead when the instance is already created.  
- **Second Check (inside `synchronized` block):** Ensures only **one instance** is created.  
- **Volatile Keyword:** Ensures visibility and prevents reordering of instructions.  

---

## **4. Using `enum` (Best for Simplicity and Thread-Safety)**
If a singleton does not require **lazy initialization**, using `enum` is the safest and most efficient approach.  

### **Example (`enum` Singleton)**
```java
public enum EnumSingleton {
    INSTANCE;
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Singleton instance");
    }
}
```
### **Why It’s Safe?**
✅ **Thread-safe by default** (handled by JVM).  
✅ **Serialization-proof** (prevents multiple instances during deserialization).  
✅ **Prevents Reflection-based attacks** (Cannot create multiple instances using reflection).  

---

### **💡 Conclusion**
- If two threads try to initialize a singleton **without synchronization**, multiple instances may be created.  
- Use **double-checked locking** (`volatile` + `synchronized`) for **optimized thread safety**.  
- Use `enum` for **simpler, reflection-safe, and thread-safe** singleton implementation.

# **Explain the shadowing of static methods.**
### **Shadowing of Static Methods in Java**  

In Java, **shadowing** occurs when a **static method** in a **subclass** has the **same signature** as a **static method** in its **superclass**. Unlike instance methods, **static methods are not overridden** but are instead **shadowed**.  

---

### **1. Key Concepts of Static Method Shadowing**  
- Static methods are **resolved at compile time** based on the **reference type** and not at runtime (like instance methods).  
- **Method overriding does not apply** to static methods.  
- The method **in the superclass is hidden** but **not overridden** by the subclass method.  
- Calling the method depends on the **reference type**, not the actual object type.

---

### **2. Example of Static Method Shadowing**  

```java
class Parent {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Child");
    }
}

public class ShadowingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p1 = new Parent();
        Parent p2 = new Child();
        Child c1 = new Child();

        p1.display();  // Output: Static method in Parent
        p2.display();  // Output: Static method in Parent (not Child)
        c1.display();  // Output: Static method in Child
    }
}
```
---

### **3. Why Does This Happen?**
- **Static methods belong to the class, not instances** → They are resolved at **compile-time**.  
- Since `p2` is declared as `Parent`, the **Parent's static method** is called, even though the object is of type `Child`.  

---

### **4. Difference Between Shadowing and Overriding**
| Feature           | Static Method Shadowing  | Method Overriding  |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Applies To       | Static methods           | Instance methods   |
| Resolution Time  | Compile-time (Reference Type) | Runtime (Object Type) |
| Behavior         | Hides method from superclass | Overrides superclass method |
| Polymorphism     | Not applicable           | Supports polymorphism |

---

### **5. Important Points**
✅ Static methods **cannot be overridden**, only hidden (shadowed).  
✅ **Reference type** determines which static method is called, not the object type.  
✅ Always use **instance methods** if polymorphic behavior is required.

# **Explain the concept of Aggegration and Composition.**
### **Aggregation and Composition in Java (Has-A Relationship)**  

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), **Aggregation** and **Composition** are two types of **Has-A relationships**, where one class contains an instance of another class. They represent **different levels of association** between objects.

---

## **1. Aggregation**
**Definition:**  
Aggregation is a **weak** form of association where one class contains a reference to another class, but both objects can exist **independently**. It represents a **"Has-A" relationship** without ownership.  

🔹 **Key Characteristics:**  
- Represents a **weak** relationship (loosely coupled).  
- The **contained object can exist independently** of the container object.  
- Uses an **association** but does not enforce lifecycle dependency.  
- Implemented using **references** to other objects.

**Example of Aggregation:**  
```java
class Address {
    String city, state, country;
    
    Address(String city, String state, String country) {
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
        this.country = country;
    }
}

class Employee {
    String name;
    Address address;  // Aggregation (Has-A Relationship)
    
    Employee(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(name + " lives in " + address.city + ", " + address.state);
    }
}

public class AggregationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address addr = new Address("Mumbai", "Maharashtra", "India");
        Employee emp = new Employee("Raj", addr);
        emp.display();
    }
}
```
🔹 **Explanation:**  
- `Employee` **has-a** `Address`, but the `Address` object **can exist independently** from the `Employee` object.
- If the `Employee` object is deleted, the `Address` object **is not deleted**.

---

## **2. Composition**
**Definition:**  
Composition is a **strong** form of association where one class owns another class, and the contained object **cannot exist independently**. It represents a **"Has-A" relationship with ownership**.

🔹 **Key Characteristics:**  
- Represents a **strong** relationship (tightly coupled).  
- The **contained object cannot exist independently** of the container.  
- If the **container object is destroyed, the contained object is also destroyed**.  
- Implemented using **instance variables**.

**Example of Composition:**  
```java
class Engine {
    Engine() {
        System.out.println("Engine Created");
    }
}

class Car {
    private final Engine engine;  // Composition (Strong Has-A Relationship)
    
    Car() {
        engine = new Engine();  // Engine is created when Car is created
    }

    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting...");
    }
}

public class CompositionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();  // Car owns Engine
        car.start();
    }
}
```
🔹 **Explanation:**  
- `Car` **has-a** `Engine`, but the `Engine` **cannot exist independently** from `Car`.  
- If `Car` is destroyed, `Engine` is **also destroyed** automatically.

---

## **3. Differences Between Aggregation and Composition**
| Feature        | Aggregation | Composition |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Type of Relationship | Weak Has-A | Strong Has-A |
| Object Dependency | Contained object can exist independently | Contained object cannot exist without container |
| Lifecycle | Independent | Dependent |
| Implementation | Uses references | Uses instance variables |
| Example | `Employee` and `Address` | `Car` and `Engine` |

---

## **4. When to Use Aggregation vs Composition?**
- **Use Aggregation** when the contained object **can exist independently** (e.g., `Student` has a `College`, but `College` exists without `Student`).
- **Use Composition** when the contained object **must depend on** the container (e.g., `Car` has an `Engine`, and the `Engine` cannot exist separately from `Car`).

# **Explain covarient return types.**
### **Covariant Return Types in Java**  

#### **Definition**  
A **covariant return type** means that an **overridden method** in a subclass can **return a more specific (subtype) object** than the method in the parent class. This feature was introduced in **Java 5** to improve type safety and avoid unnecessary type casting.

---

### **1. Key Rules of Covariant Return Types**  
- The method in the **subclass** must **override** the method in the **parent class**.
- The **return type** of the overridden method **must be a subclass** of the return type declared in the parent class.
- It improves **readability** and avoids **explicit type casting**.

---

### **2. Example Without Covariant Return Types (Before Java 5)**  
Before Java 5, the overridden method **had to return the exact same type** as the superclass method. This led to **explicit type casting**.  

```java
class Animal {
    Animal get() {  // Parent method returning Animal
        return this;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog get() {  // This would cause a compilation error before Java 5
        return this;
    }

    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking...");
    }
}

public class CovariantExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        Animal a = d.get();  // Returns Animal, requires explicit casting

        Dog d2 = (Dog) a;  // Explicit cast required
        d2.bark();
    }
}
```
🔹 **Problem:**  
- Before Java 5, we **had to cast** the returned object (`(Dog) a`), which **increases error risk**.

---

### **3. Example With Covariant Return Types (Java 5+)**  
With **covariant return types**, the overridden method in the subclass **can return a subclass type**, avoiding explicit casting.  

```java
class Animal {
    Animal get() {  // Parent method returning Animal
        return this;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    Dog get() {  // Overridden method returns Dog (subclass of Animal)
        return this;
    }

    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking...");
    }
}

public class CovariantExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        Dog d2 = d.get();  // No explicit casting needed
        d2.bark();
    }
}
```
🔹 **Advantages:**  
- No **explicit casting** is required.
- The return type is **more specific**, improving **type safety**.
- Makes the code **cleaner and easier to read**.

---

### **4. Example with Factory Pattern**
Covariant return types are commonly used in the **Factory Pattern** to return more specific instances.

```java
class Vehicle {
    Vehicle create() {
        return new Vehicle();
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    Car create() {
        return new Car();  // Covariant return type
    }
}

public class FactoryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        Car newCar = car.create();  // No casting needed
        System.out.println("New car object created: " + newCar);
    }
}
```
---

### **5. When to Use Covariant Return Types?**  
- When **overriding methods**, and you need a more specific return type.
- When working with **factories** or **builder patterns**, where returning a more specialized instance makes sense.
- When **avoiding unnecessary type casting** improves code readability and maintainability.
