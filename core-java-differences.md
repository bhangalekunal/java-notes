# Introduction
Java is one of the most popular programming languages, and understanding its core concepts is crucial for any developer. In this blog, weâ€™ll explore some essential differences between key Java concepts. These distinctions will help you write better code and ace your interviews!

## 1. Process vs Thread
| **Process**                                                                                      | **Thread**                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Process is a heavy-weight task currently in execution.                                           | Thread is a lightweight process.                                                              |
| Every process has its own address space.                                                        | Every thread shares the address space of the process that created it.                         |
| A program can be broken down into one or more processes.                                         | A process creates one or more threads to accomplish its tasks.                                |
| The operating system takes more time to create a process.                                        | The operating system takes less time to create a thread.                                      |
| Process-based multitasking allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently.        | Thread-based multitasking allows a single program to perform two or more tasks simultaneously.|
| Process-based multitasking allows you to run more than one program at a time (e.g., running a Java compiler while using a text editor). | Thread-based multitasking allows tasks within a program (e.g., a text editor formatting text and painting simultaneously). |
| In process-based multitasking, a program is the smallest unit of code dispatched by the scheduler.| In thread-based multitasking, the thread is the smallest unit of dispatchable code.            |
| Multitasking processes require more overhead than multitasking threads.                         | Multitasking threads require less overhead than multitasking processes.                       |
| Processes are heavy-weight tasks that require their own address space.                          | Threads are lightweight tasks that share the same address space.                              |
| Inter-process communication is expensive and limited.                                            | Inter-thread communication is inexpensive.                                                    |
| Context switching from one process to another is costly.                                         | Context switching from one thread to another is low cost.                                     |


## 2. wait() vs sleep()
| **wait()**                                              | **sleep()**                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `wait()` method releases the lock of the monitor.       | `sleep()` method does not release the lock of the monitor.|
| Cannot call the `wait()` method outside a synchronized block or method. | Can call the `sleep()` method anywhere in the class.      |
| `wait()` method is present in the `Object` class.       | `sleep()` method is present in the `Thread` class.       |
| `wait()` is a non-static method.                        | `sleep()` is a static method.                            |

## 3. Stack Memory vs Heap Memory
|                                                         | **Stack**                                              |  **Heap**                                    | 
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Memory`        |  Stack memory is used only by one thread of execution. | Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application.|
